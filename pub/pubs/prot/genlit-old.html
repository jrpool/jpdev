<h2 style="text-align: center">Notes on the Literature of Genocide</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Analytical Categories</h3>

<p>We have five basic questions about genocide. We hope to find answers to them in the literature of genocide.</p>

<dl>

<dh>1. Definitions (What is genocide?)</dh>
<dd>What does "genocide" mean? Is genocide defined by intent, method, or result? Are there scientific, legal, and political definitions, and, if so, are they compatible? Is genocide a special case of a more general category, and are there further special cases of genocide? Can there be degrees of genocide? Is the definition of genocide consensual or conflictual? If there are conflicts over the definition, what are the stakes of the outcome? Is genocide a universal concept or one whose meaning (like "poverty") is contextually variable? Does defining "genocide" have legal or other behavioral consequences?</dd>

<dh>2. Causes (Why genocide?)</dh>
<dd>What are the causes and motives of genocide? Under what physical, social, intellectual, and emotional conditions does genocide take place? What makes people lead genocidal movements? What makes people participate in them? What makes people vulnerable to them? Are there innate propensities for or against genocide? Are the motivations for genocide economic, political, religious, or ethnic? Do people participate in genocide out of hatred, fear, cruelty, or impassivity? Do people participate in genocide willingly, neutrally, or reluctantly? Do people make genocidal choices as rational means to ends or as emotional expressions? Do repetitive participants in genocide become less resistant to participation with increasing experience? Do participants in genocide exhibit a need to justify their behavior morally? Are goals of genocidal behavior overtly expressed, and, if so, are they formulated so as to make it possible to characterize a genocide as successful or unsuccessful?</dd>

<dh>3. Mechanisms (How does genocide work?)</dh>
<dd>Are there typical life (or death) cycles of genocides? Do they sometimes get aborted early, and, if so, how? What are the leading indicators of genocide? What stages do genocides proceed through? Who starts genocides? Are genocides provoked or encouraged by foreign agents? What messages are disseminated, and how and to whom, by those who organize or direct genocides? How centrally or diffusely are genocides planned and conducted? How do near and distant individuals and organizations respond to evolving genocides? Do the methods used in the performance of each genocide become more efficacious or routine as the genocide ages? Under what conditions do the victims of genocides resist, seek external intervention, seek to flee, panic, become paralyzed, hide, become individually coopted, become double agents, commit suicide, and cooperate meekly? What kinds of nonvictim resistance occur? Do genocides evolve into businesses in which some interests are served by the labor of unkilled victims or in the production or commercialization of corpses? After genocides end, what processes of punishment, retribution, retaliation, reconciliation, disclosure, denial, suppression and falsification of records, and commemoration take place?</dd>

<dh>4. Effects (What does genocide do?)</dh>
<dd>What does genocide do to the countries where it takes place? How does it affect politics, society, economics, science, literature, the arts, ethics, and religion? What does it do to the rest of the world? Does genocide matter to those far away? What effects to migrations of genocidal refugees have on countries of refuge and settlement? How does the recurrence of genocide affect movements for the adoption and enforcement of international law? Do individuals and organizations learn lessons from genocides? Do genocides provide opportunities or excuses for transnational collaboration? Do genocidal histories interfere with diplomatic and popular relations between countries related to the perpetrator and victim groups?</dd>

<dh>5. Solutions (What shall we do about genocide?)</dh>
<dd>Can the conditions conducive to genocide be eliminated? Can people be educated into genocide-proofness? Would democratization prevent genocide, or guarantee its perpetuation? Is the prevention of genocide a right, or a duty, and, if so, whose? Does genocide invalidate claims to sovereignty? Does the prospect of punishment for genocide deter its commission? Do sanctions against genocidal governments cause genocides to stop? What formal regional and world institutions of intervention against genocide exist, and are they effective? Could genocide be criminalized? What properties would an effective genocide intervention force have? Does ethnic segregation guard against genocide or make it more likely to occur? Is genocide preventable only if committed by small, non-nuclear powers? Can mass publics be mobilized against distant genocides? Do innovations in information technology and telecommunications provide new tools for genocide disclosure and control?</dd>

While most authors refer to economic or cultural explanations for the genocide, Mamdani explores ... political explanations, in particular ... identity politics".

Mann suggests that democratization in particular multiethnic settings can create situations in which 'rule by the people' is defined in ethnic terms, leading a majority group to tyrannize minorities." <a href="http://www.cjsonline.ca/reviews/darkside.html">Review</a>: "impressive in its historical dimensions. Mann has done a great deal of original research. He even provides a major empirical contribution in ... Nazi Germany .... The temporal perspective of the book is long. Finally, Mann has a talent for narration -- for sketching biographies and thickly describing episodes of murderous conduct. ...  substantial chapters on the cleansings that occurred in North America, Armenia, the Nazi regime and its allied states, three communist regimes (Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot), Yugoslavia, and Rwanda. ...  the book was disappointing only on the theoretical level. ... the theses are so diverse that, at every moment of the book's unfolding, Mann can reach into his collection of claims and suggest that at least one of them is being confirmed. ...  about fifteen distinct theses. ... how do the theses inter-relate? What is the architecture that unifies them, either by making them compatible with each other or by establishing a hierarchy of truthfulness among them? ... chaotic relationship among the arguments. ... Mann has done a great deal of research into the social backgrounds and personal motives of people who kill others on the basis of their ethnicity. What distinguished the perpetrator of ethnic violence from other members of the populations? Some excellent parts of the book stem from Mann's systematic and thoughtful examination of this issue. His analysis of the Nazis is a veritable tour de force." Author's rebuttal: "... my theses are only empirical tendencies, lacking universal applicability. None of them apply unequivocally to all my cases .... I also say repeatedly that my model does worst in the Nazi case, and so we should not take the Holocaust as being the typical case ...."</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr>

The resonance is deep, from Auschwitz to My Lai, the connections unavoidable, the implications altogether cheerless". Roger Brown (Harvard): "Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to malevolent authority seemed to me to be the most important social psychological research done in this generation.... The quality of exposition in the book is so high that it qualifies as literature as well as science."</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr>

First, because his is one of the first serious attempts to deal systematically with the responsibility of those on the outside ....
