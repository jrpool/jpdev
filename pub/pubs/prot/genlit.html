<h2 style="text-align: center">Notes on the Literature of Genocide</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Analytical Categories</h3>

<p>Here are five basic groups of questions about genocide.</p>

<dl>

<dh>1. Definitions (What is genocide?)</dh>
<dd>What does "genocide" mean? Is genocide defined by intent, method, or result? Are there scientific, legal, and political definitions, and, if so, are they compatible? Is genocide a special case of a more general category, and are there further special cases of genocide? Can there be degrees of genocide? Is the definition of genocide consensual or conflictual? If there are conflicts over the definition, what are the stakes of the outcome? Is genocide a universal concept or one whose meaning (like "poverty") is contextually variable? Does defining "genocide" have legal or other behavioral consequences?</dd>

<dh>2. Causes (Why genocide?)</dh>
<dd>What are the causes and motives of genocide? Under what physical, social, intellectual, and emotional conditions does genocide take place? What makes people lead genocidal movements? What makes people participate in them? What makes people vulnerable to them? Are there innate propensities for or against genocide? Are the motivations for genocide economic, political, religious, or ethnic? Do people participate in genocide out of hatred, fear, cruelty, or impassivity? Do people participate in genocide willingly, neutrally, or reluctantly? Do people make genocidal choices as rational means to ends or as emotional expressions? Do repetitive participants in genocide become less resistant to participation with increasing experience? Do participants in genocide exhibit a need to justify their behavior morally? Are goals of genocidal behavior overtly expressed, and, if so, are they formulated so as to make it possible to characterize a genocide as successful or unsuccessful?</dd>

<dh>3. Mechanisms (How does genocide work?)</dh>
<dd>Are there typical life (or death) cycles of genocides? Do they sometimes get aborted early, and, if so, how? What are the leading indicators of genocide? What stages do genocides proceed through? Who starts genocides? Are genocides provoked or encouraged by foreign agents? What messages are disseminated, and how and to whom, by those who organize or direct genocides? How centrally or diffusely are genocides planned and conducted? How do near and distant individuals and organizations respond to evolving genocides? Do the methods used in the performance of each genocide become more efficacious or routine as the genocide ages? Under what conditions do the victims of genocides resist, seek external intervention, seek to flee, panic, become paralyzed, hide, become individually coopted, become double agents, commit suicide, and cooperate meekly? What kinds of nonvictim resistance occur? Do genocides evolve into businesses in which some interests are served by the labor of unkilled victims or in the production or commercialization of corpses? After genocides end, what processes of punishment, retribution, retaliation, reconciliation, disclosure, denial, suppression and falsification of records, and commemoration take place?</dd>

<dh>4. Effects (What does genocide do?)</dh>
<dd>What does genocide do to the countries where it takes place? How does it affect politics, society, economics, science, literature, the arts, ethics, and religion? What does it do to the rest of the world? Does genocide matter to those far away? What effects do migrations of genocidal refugees have on countries of refuge and settlement? How does the recurrence of genocide affect movements for the adoption and enforcement of international law? Do individuals and organizations learn lessons from genocides? Do genocides provide opportunities or excuses for transnational collaboration? Do genocidal histories interfere with diplomatic and popular relations between countries related to the perpetrator and victim groups?</dd>

<dh>5. Solutions (What shall we do about genocide?)</dh>
<dd>Can the conditions conducive to genocide be eliminated? Can people be educated into genocide-proofness? Would democratization prevent genocide, or guarantee its perpetuation? Is the prevention of genocide a right, or a duty, and, if so, whose? Does genocide invalidate claims to sovereignty? Does the prospect of punishment for genocide deter its commission? Do sanctions against genocidal governments cause genocides to stop? What formal regional and world institutions of intervention against genocide exist, and are they effective? Could genocide be criminalized? What properties would an effective genocide intervention force have? Does ethnic segregation guard against genocide or make it more likely to occur? Is genocide preventable only if committed by small, non-nuclear powers? Can mass publics be mobilized against distant genocides? Do innovations in information technology, telecommunications, and pathology provide new tools for genocide disclosure and control?</dd>

<tr><td>causes mechanisms</td><td>Taner Akcam</td><td>From Empire to Republic: Turkish Nationalism and the Armenian Genocide</td><td>2004</td><td>Zed</td><td><a href="http://www.isg-iags.org/newsletters/isg33/smith.html">Review</a>: "powerful book by the Turkish historian .... His central argument is that there are deep continuities between the Young Turk regime and the Republic .... forging of Turkish identity from the trauma arising out of 'military defeats, territorial losses, national humiliation at the hands of foreign powers,' and fear for the very existence of Turkey in a world perceived to be full of foreign and domestic enemies. .... The way the Young Turks dealt with the society was through massacre and ethnic cleansing of 'alien' elements; the Republic ... imposed a set of taboos that denied the existence of different classes, ethnic groups and cultural differences. ... The organizers of the Turkish independence movement after World War I were persons who had participated in the genocide; ... many of these were given important posts .... 'The devastation that would ensue if Turks had now to stigmatize ... those whom they are used to regarding as "great saviors" and "people who created a nation out of nothing," is palpable. It seems so much simpler to deny the Genocide completely ....'"</td><td>4</td></tr>

Mob rule seen as legit form of social control. Focuses on concept of JUSTICE. Misc: Combing through original sources, including eye-witness accounts never before published, Frederick Allen concludes that the vigilantes were justified in their early actions, as they fought violent crime in a remote corner beyond the reach of government. But Allen has uncovered evidence that the vigilantes refused to disband after territorial courts were in place. Remaining active for six years, they lynched more than fifty men without trials. Reliance on mob rule in Montana became so ingrained that in 1883, a Helena newspaper editor advocated a return to "decent, orderly lynching" as a legitimate tool of social control. Allen’s sharply drawn characters, illustrated by dozens of photographs, are woven into a masterfully written narrative that will change textbook accounts of Montana’s early days—and challenge our thinking on the essence of justice. Not about genocide.</td><td>2</td></tr>

Hence, he examines in great detail how Israel has dealt with the Armenian genocide. The pattern that he traces is one of initial avoidance, then passive denial, and since the 1990s, an active denial by political officials, bureaucrats in the educational system, those presiding over the non-print media, and a growing number of academics who sound, for all the world, like Heath Lowry and the Turkish government. ... He attributes this to political expediency and to pressure from within Israel not to 'dilute' the moral force of the Holocaust .... one wishes that Auron had examined the claim that recognizing the Armenian genocide or any other genocide would some how diminish the moral significance of the Holocaust. Is there any empirical evidence that this could result? On the other hand, might not such a recognition have a liberating effect, achieving Auron's vision of victims standing with victims? ... Jews, Armenians, Cambodians, and Tutsis have no greater obligation than other peoples to recognize the sufferings of other victims. However, I wish that Auron had dealt more with why denial matters. He tends to treat it as a moral issue only, but it has far reaching consequences that extend in many directions."</td><td>3</td></tr>

<tr><td>effects solutions</td><td>Peter Balakian</td><td>The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response</td><td>2004</td><td>Harper Perennial</td><td>Argument: U.S. policy is evasive, sluggish, resistant to action ... in response to genocide because policy is driven by interests rather than by a moral code. Thus we can see how in the case of Armenia, where there was broad media coverage and massive public empathy, there was no swift govt response. Still there were individuals (in US govt, diplomatic corps, etc.) who did in fact intervene--but as individuals. Misc: It is important to know that the Armenian Genocide prompted two historic responses in the evolution of international ethics. In May 1915, in the midst of World War I, the Allies meeting in London conceived of what they termed "crimes against humanity," in warning the Ottoman government that massacring the Armenian population would violate a fundamental standard of humanity and would have consequences. In 1944, the Polish jurist Raphael Lemkin coined the term genocide and based his definition in large part by what had happened to the Armenians in 1915 and what was happening to the Jews of Europe. By the early 1920s, the American response to the "starving Armenians" was divided between a passionate popular appeal for aid and justice, and the limits of the federal government--the State Department, the White House, and a powerful segment of the Senate, which was isolationist and Republican. The post-World-War-I power alliance with Atat&uuml;rk's new Turkish Republic and the American drive for oil in the Middle East led to the abandonment of Armenia. In some sense, this paradox would haunt the United States through the 20th century and beyond, when it was faced with the challenge of genocide and other human rights atrocities, whether committed in Europe against the Jews, or in Cambodia, Rwanda, Iraq, or Bosnia. <a href="http://www.isg-iags.org/newsletters/isg33/smith.html">Review</a>: "beautifully written and carefully crafted book ... addresses all of the themes touched upon by those who approach the Armenian genocide in terms of America's response to it ... with greater depth in most instances and includes material on the massacres in 1894-96 that the other accounts omit. ... detailed, heartwrenching accounts of the Turkish massacres of some 200,000 Armenians in the 1890s, and of the genocide, beginning in 1915, that claimed the lives of at least a million Armenians. ... describes the dedication and courage of American diplomats, who tried, with little support from the State Department, to end the carnage. ... the story of a broadly based American humanitarian movement that sought to provide aid to the Armenians ... and that demanded that the U.S. government protect them from further violence. ... shows ... a growing conflict between public opinion, which strongly supported an independent Armenia, and a Congress and White House that had other interests. ... documents Turkey's continuing denial of the Armenian genocide and its efforts, largely successful, to enlist the White House and the State Department in defeating Congressional resolutions that would publicly recognize the genocide. ... shows both the impact of public opinion and its limitations.</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><td>mechanisms solutions</td><td>Michael Barnett</td><td>Eyewitness to a Genocide: The United Nations and Rwanda</td><td>2002</td><td>Cornell University Press</td><td>Based on personal experiences, archival work, and interviews with many key participants. Argument: "indifference was driven not by incompetence or cynicism but rather by reasoned choices cradled by moral considerations …. UN [institutional] culture recast the ethical commitments of well-intentioned individuals, arresting any duty to aid at the outset of the genocide …. [Also asks] whether it is possible to build moral institutions." Misc: Using an organizational-ethics framework, he assesses the UN's moral responsibility for the ensuing holocaust. He first sketches the world body's shifting role following the Cold War and then dissects who said and did what about Rwanda in 1993-94, pointing out the sins of commission and omission by the Security Council, the Secretariat, its Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and the latter's field force, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda. His theme is the moral universe of the UN and the particular ways its bureaucratic and political cultures construct reality. At every level except that of the field operation, he finds a pattern of "willful ignorance and indifference" toward Rwanda and a prioritizing of institutional interests over the obligations set forth in the 1948 Genocide Convention. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4106/is_200309/ai_n9241307">Review</a>: "While Barnett effectively demonstrates the impotence of the UN to react morally and ethically to genocide, he avoids blaming individuals and instead attributes this impotence to the discursive forces that rob otherwise moral, ethical individuals of their personal agency. A more radical critique of this situation might suggest that those with the knowledge, power, and capacity to intervene in genocide are even more culpable than those illiterate peasants in Rwanda who actually wielded the machetes."</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>mechanisms</td><td>Gary Jonathan Bass</td><td>Stay the Hand of Vengeance: The Politics of War Crimes Tribunals</td><td>2000</td><td>Princeton University Press</td><td>Combines analysis with investigative reporting and a broad historical perspective. Uses primary documents (new archival research) to examine the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, the Armenian genocide, World War II, and the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia. Argument: concludes that, although not all prosecutions are effective, it is still worthwhile to pursue them because "trying war criminals is a better option than its alternative: revenge". Misc: "asks how law and international politics interact, and how power can be made to serve the cause of justice …. Bass explains that bringing war criminals to justice can be a military ordeal, a source of endless legal frustration, as well as a diplomatic nightmare." <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_10_32/ai_66495298">Review</a>: "Bass makes clear that ... the prosecution of war criminals is not an absolute carried out in accordance with universal standards. However, he does not deal with the question of whether existing standards should be compromised or negotiated away in order to produce settlements that can save hundreds of thousands of lives or improve the observance of human rights in a particular country."</td><td>3</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes mechanisms</td><td>Zygmunt Bauman</td><td>Modernity and the Holocaust</td><td>2001</td><td>Cornell University Press</td><td>Publisher: "Among the conditions that made the mass extermination of the Holocaust possible, according to Bauman, the most decisive factor was modernity itself." Criticized by Mann for comparatively ill-fitting explanation.</td><td>3</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes</td><td>Michael Bilton and Kevin Sim</td><td>Four Hours in My Lai</td><td>1992</td><td>Viking Adult</td><td>Argument: My Lai occurred because of poor training, lack of discipline, and the incompetent and negligent leadership provided by the officers in command of this unit all the way up the chain of command to the division level. Misc: On March 16, 1968, a battle scarred American fighting unit entered the Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai and massacred 400 unarmed women, children, and old men. Only four of the soldiers were ever brought to trial; and only one was convicted. Not directly about genocide.</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr><td>solutions</td><td>Sumantra Bose</td><td>Bosnia After Dayton: Nationalist Partition and International Intervention</td><td>2002</td><td>Oxford University Press</td><td>Argument: Measuring up the arguments for and against Dayton and for and against Bosnian unity, Bose gives a measured endorsement of both, and of the second as dependent upon the first. In Bose's opinion, Western politicians and diplomats rightly seek to work within the status quo created by Dayton, 'since they know that any revision of Dayton in response to pressure orchestrated by a particular faction will not only open up a Pandora's Box of competing claims, but reopen issues lying dormant since the war' [emphasis in original]. For Bose, the contradictions inherent in Dayton Bosnia are merely reflections of a contradictory reality in which there are no simple solutions. Misc: Book asks: How effective are international peace-building interventions in fractured states? Is the preservation of a multinational state desirable--or even possible--where the majority of citizens only reluctantly acknowledge its legitimacy? Not directly about genocide.</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes mechanisms</td><td>Paul R. Brass</td><td>The Production of Hindu-Muslim Violence in Contemporary India</td><td>2003</td><td>University of Washington Press</td><td>Based on qualitative research (case study) with Aligarh, India, as the case. Argument: various actors (police, criminals, business community, political elites) are involved in the production of communal violence. Misc: Brass exposes the mechanisms by which endemic communal violence is deliberately provoked and sustained. He convincingly implicates the police, criminal elements, members of Aligarh's business community, and many of its leading political actors in the continuous effort to "produce" communal violence. Much like a theatrical production, specific roles are played, with phases for rehearsal, staging, and interpretation. In this way, riots become key historical markers in the struggle for political, economic, and social dominance of one community over another. About riots rather than genocide, but is the distinction clear, e.g. in Rwanda 1994?</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>mechanisms</td><td>Paul R. Brass</td><td>Theft of an Idol</td><td>1997</td><td>Princeton University Press</td><td>Five case studies of both rural and urban public violence in India, including police-public confrontations and Hindu-Muslim riots. Argument: the media reports on contemporary collective violence in such a way that the outbreaks are linked to age-old ethnic or religious hostilities, thereby freeing the state, its agents, and its political elites from responsibility. Of many possible interpretations applicable to these incidents, government and the media select those that support existing relations of power in state and society. Misc: Brass treats incidents of collective violence arising initially out of common occurrences such as a drunken brawl, the rape of a girl, and the theft of an idol, and demonstrates how some incidents remain localized while others are fit into broader frameworks of meaning, thereby becoming useful for upholders of dominant ideologies. Incessant talk about violence and its implications in these circumstances contributes to its persistence rather than its reduction. Such treatment serves in fact to mask the causes of violence, displace the victims from the center of attention, and divert society's gaze from those responsible for its endemic character. Brass explains how this process ultimately implicates everyone in the perpetuation of systems of violence. Not directly about genocide.</td><td>3</td></tr>

<tr><td>effects solutions</td><td>Svetlana Broz</td><td>Good People in an Evil Time: Portraits of Complicity and Resistance in the Bosnian War</td><td>2004</td><td>Other</td><td>Collection of 90 interviews about resistance to war crimes, including ethnic cleansing and genocide. Interviewees are resisters themselves, beneficiaries, and other witnesses. Evidence presented by interviewees shows what kinds of alternatives individuals were able to choose among when expected by those in power to participate in cruelty and destruction, and what the consequences (including rewards and costs) of compliance and resistance were. Also documents suffering caused by ethnic cleansing to direct and indirect victims and witnesses. Argument: Compliance with demands for participation in crimes against humanity is not the only alternative. Implication: One kind of solution to genocide is education for limits on compliance. Seems to make a claim opposite to that of Monroe on the basis of similar evidence: Monroe argues that rescuers were compelled to resist by their personalities, not free to choose.

<tr><td>causes mechanisms</td><td>Greg Campbell</td><td>Blood Diamonds: Tracing the Deadly Path of the World's Most Precious Stones</td><td>2002</td><td>Westview</td><td>Journalistic study. Argument: Conflict diamonds are used to finance civil wars and international terrorists. Nonetheless western capitalists do not care about the costs which affect people in distant countries. Misc: Freelance journalist Campbell here writes about the cost of diamonds not in dollars to the consumer but in blood, torture, and death for the unfortunate residents of contested mining areas in Sierra Leone. He explains that "conflict diamonds," or "blood diamonds," which account for only three to four percent of all diamonds sold, are mined in war zones, smuggled out of the country, and sold to legitimate companies, financing ruinous civil wars and the plots of international terrorists, including the al Qaeda network. The gems' value and portability have made controlling the diamond mines important to guerrilla fighters, who maim and kill innocent villagers to secure their territory. Campbell has spoken with individuals all along the pipeline, from miners to soldiers to smugglers, and the grim portrait he paints will make many people think twice about buying another diamond. While Matthew Hart's Diamond: A Journey to the Heart of an Obsession covered the international diamond trade more widely, this focused study of the catastrophic effect of blood diamonds on Sierra Leone belongs in all libraries. Not directly about genocide.</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes</td><td>Caleb Carr</td><td>The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians</td><td>2003</td><td>Random House</td><td>Historical study. Argument: Carr argues that terrorism is nothing new and that it is not a political or sociological issue. Terrorism  is as old as warfare itself, and, indeed, it is warfare, the kind of warfare "deliberately waged against civilians" to break the enemy's will. Misc: A brief history of terrorism intended to be a corrective to the widespread perception spread by ill-informed journalists and politicians that the September 11 attacks were unique and unprecedented. Carr argues from the start that terrorism must be viewed in terms of "military history, rather than political science or sociology," and that the refusal to label terrorists as soldiers, rather than criminals, is a mistake. Underlying Carr's argument is the view that a repugnant bloodthirstiness arises when one civilization, no matter how advanced, encounters another. Not directly about genocide.</td><td>2</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes</td><td>David Chandler</td><td>Voices from S-21: Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison</td><td>2000</td><td>University of California Press</td><td>Study of Cambodia, based on archival materials from concentration camp S-21 and interviews with former prisoners and prison workers. Argument appears to be: turning victims into "others" in a manner that was systematically devaluing and racialist made it easier to mistreat and kill them. He concludes: "places like S-21 and Nazi concentration camps originate in our own everyday capacities to order and obey, form bonds against outsiders, seek perfection and approval and vent anger and frustration upon the helpless." Misc: Documenting the violence and terror that took place within S-2, Chandler presents the psychological dimensions of state-sponsored terrorism that conditions human beings to commit acts of unspeakable brutality. Chandler discusses the "culture of obedience" and its attendant dehumanization, citing parallels between the Khmer Rouge executions and the Moscow Show Trails of the 1930s, Nazi genocide, Indonesian massacres in 1965-66, the Argentine military's use of torture in the 1970s, and the recent mass killings in Bosnia and Rwanda. In each of these instances, Chandler shows how turning victims into "others" in a manner that was systematically devaluing and racialist made it easier to mistreat and kill them. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3680/is_200101/ai_n8942158">Review</a>: "a horrifying, but paradoxically dispassionate, picture .... a disturbing running theme in the interviews ... is that they were simply 'doing their job.' ... Chandler approaches this Kafkaesque horror with compassion, but also with a kind of studied disinterest rare among Cambodia scholars. He describes the experience as 'sometimes like drowning.' To even begin to understand how this terror could have happened, one has to appreciate the level of mortal fear that Pol Pot and his inner circle were able to instil throughout Democratic Kampuchea ...."</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>definitions causes</td><td>Ward Churchill</td><td>A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas, 1492 to the Present</td><td>1997</td><td>City Lights</td><td>Historical study. Argument: Churchill examines the definition of genocide--in legal as well as cultural terms--and demonstrates that holocaust and denial have a specific American history that reaches back 500 years and continues into the present day. He vehemently argues against the notion that the only genocide ever to have taken place was the Jewish Holocaust. Advocates a broad definition of genocide. Misc: Churchill looks at the "ethnic cleansing" which made America what it is today, how under the banner of manifest destiny this continent was virtually cleared of its human population. The definition of genocide that he uses can be readily applied to various other atrocities, such as the genocide that occurred in Rwanda, Israel (Israelis against Palestinians), Vietnam (first by the French, and later the US), and most recently Iraq (perpetrated by the US) and Sudan.   Various genocide references are made: Cambodian (Khmer Rouge), Armenian (Turks), Gypsies, Poles and Jews (Nazi) and those occurring in North, Central and South America. Even fetal genocide is mentioned. A concluding discussion and definition of genocide, actions of the UN General Assembly and some clarifying of definitions and intents of meaning in Articles 1-V111 of the Convention on Prevention and Punishment of Genocide (1948). <a href="http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb99-1/books99-1.html">Review</a>: "an achievement of staggering scholarship."; analyzes denial of American genocide as indefensible but fundamentally like (Jewish-only) exclusivism; proposes new convention redefining "genocide". <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/104.3/br_3.html">Review</a>: "The reader should not be too distracted by errors and interpretations that seem to weaken the overall argument, an argument that is far too important to be dismissed on such grounds. ... seems quite prepared to ignore his own definition when it suits him. Thus, he does not explain how 'Israel's ongoing genocide against the Palestinian population' (p. 74) fits into his definition of genocide."</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>definitions causes effects</td><td>Ward Churchill</td><td>Kill the Indian, Save the Man</td><td>2004</td><td>City Lights</td><td>Historical study. Argument: Indian residential schools (in US and Canada) were a tool of cultural genocide. Advocates a broad definition of genocide. Misc: This concise discussion is a continuum to Churchill's longer 1997 work, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas. The author first analyzes the term genocide (coined by Raphael Lemkin in 1944), stressing that the phrase covers not only physical extermination of a people but also biological genocide (policies to prevent births within a group) and cultural genocide. The Indian residential schools in both the U.S and Canada fall squarely into this latter category, which includes the forced exile of children and the prohibition of the use of a national language or religion. Churchill next turns his attention to the schools themselves, uncovering a host of grim details. In Canada, half of the children sent to residential schools did not survive because of rampant disease, near-starvation diets, and brutal labor. In fact, Churchill observes that survivors display a level of dysfunction similar to that exhibited by concentration camp survivors. Churchill presents a bleak yet utterly necessary history of a brutal system that was in effect until 1990. Review in <i>Choice</i>, 42:10, 1882: "As expected from such a controversial author, this book is a polemic for which Churchill (Univ. of Colorado) admits he 'engaged in no new research.' Churchill conflates the histories of Canadian and US Indian schools, which in many ways were very different. He draws only negative material from existing histories, covering mostly the late 19th- and early 20th-century period. George Tinker's introduction sets the tone, saying that Indian schools' mechanisms of genocide, purely, simply, 'by any other name'--are the cause of all the problems Indians have today and that the schools' employees and supporters are to be classed with the Nazi Adolph Eichmann. ... too often, the footnotes do not support what is referenced. There is an element of truth in this book, but it is hardly the whole truth. The pedophilia and other abuse that occurred in some schools is used to paint all Canadian residential and US boarding schools as torture chambers, which makes one wonder how some Indians found their school days 'the best years' of their lives and came home to become tribal leaders. Summing Up: Not recommended."</td><td>2</td></tr>

Part of plot: "Hutu family ... have been masquerading as Tutsis .... Now the tables are turned and ... she is being penalised for being the Tutsi she actually is not." Describes mixture of genocide, AIDS, and sex. <a href="http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/kigali.html">Review</a>: "both a love story and a searing account of the Rwandan genocide. At his best, Courtemanche recites the litany of atrocity with powerful journalistic detachment; at his worst, he superimposes on that horror an unconvincing love affair and a woolly minded moral philosophy. .... The most pitiful victims of the Rwandan Holocaust are the women and children. Here, Courtemanche is at his most powerful and moving. ... But a curious double standard pertains." <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JQP/is_358/ai_105767357">Review</a>: "sets the lives of these individuals against a vast political backdrop, including the AIDS crisis ravaging Africa and the savagery of the 'structural adjustment' imposed by the IMF and the World Bank. These issues sit awkwardly in the novel, though, and the momentous subject matter often overwhelms the personal narratives. That said, this is a moving and brave meditation on love and evil as well as a scathing indictment of an 'international community' inert and complicit in the face of genocide."

<tr><td>mechanisms effects solutions</td><td>Rom&eacute;o Dallaire</td><td>Shake Hands with the Devil</td><td>2003</td><td>Random House</td><td>Eyewitness and diary-based account of Rwanda. Argument: Rwanda-like situations are fires that can be put out with a small force if caught early enough. Misc: Dallaire puts unsparing blame (for Rwanda) on the circular failure of the UN: lack of support from member countries, especially the U.S and the Security Council, which led to lack of respect for the UN, which then led to lack of support from member countries. He blames the warring sides, especially extremist Hutus, for planning the genocide during peace talks, knowing the UN would not have the courage to enforce the peace. And he blames himself for his political naivete and his inability to convince the UN of the gravity of the situation, which has now spread to neighboring Congo. From Robert D. Steele (via amazon.com): I see this book as a massive indictment of the United Nations culture of "go along gently", as a compelling documentary of how ignorant the United Nations is about impending disasters because of its persistent refusal to establish a UN intelligence secretariat as recommended by the Brahimi Report, and as a case study in how the Western nations have failed to establish coherent global strategies--and the intelligence-policy dialogues necessary to keep such strategies updated and relevant. <a href="http://www.ontario.cmha.ca/content/reading_room/review_dallaire.asp">Review</a>: Also about effects of genocide on mental health of intervenors, with author as case study: rage, violence, guilt, depression, wish to die, attempts at suicide, PTSD, and ultimate conversion of own impairment to crusade for both humane foreign policy and humane treatment of emotional illness among military personnel.</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><td>causes solutions</td><td>Philip Dray</td><td>At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America</td><td>2003</td><td>Modern Library</td><td>Historical and cultural study. Argument: Lynching was part of a "systematized reign of terror that was used to maintain the power whites had over blacks." This violent "justice," meted out "at the hands of persons unknown", held African American communities in terror and was one force behind the exodus of black southerners to the north in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Misc: Between 1882 and 1944 at least 3,417 African-Americans were lynched in the United States, an average of slightly more than one a week. It was not until 1952, as Dray notes, that a full year went by without a reported racial lynching. Covering the South's resistance to racial equality from Reconstruction and the 1875 Civil Rights Act (which gave rise to the widespread acceptance of public murders) through the mid-20th century, this prodigiously researched, tightly written and compelling history of the lynching of African-Americans examines the social background behind the horrific acts. Yet Dray (We Are Not Afraid) also covers the myriad attempts of popular and judicial resistance to lynching, in particular the campaigns led by Ida B. Wells and by the NAACP. <a href="http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/sese/Austin.pdf">Review</a>: "Racism gives ordinary people permission to commit murder. However, several questions remain unanswered [after Tolnay and Beck]. Does racial ideology, for the most part, only provide a technique of neutralizing legal and moral prohibitions against torture and murder? Might racism (also) be a positive motive to lynch Blacks? Because of the split-labor arrangements of a caste society, Whites were far more likely to be in direct competition with members of the lynch mob, yet their supporters did not lynch each other. Is lynching only about intimidating Blacks? Might lynching (also) be a ritual the purpose of which is to affirm Whiteness? Why did those persons who desired to murder Blacks select lynching as the means of closing the labor market? What explains the murder of women and children? With whom were they in competition? These and other questions indicate gaps in our understanding of lynching that can only be filled in by exploring the cognition of southern Whites, that is, pursuing evidence of motive and determining responsibility. ... This is the hidden strength of <i>Without Sanctuary</i> and <i>Persons Unknown</i>: These books move us to consider those facets of the southern mind and features of the White community that escape quantification. ...  <i>Persons Unknown</i> is a work of strict historical narrative and is therefore undertheorized. ... despite weaknesses, <i>Persons Unknown</i>, <i>Without Sanctuary</i>, and <i>Willing Executioners</i> succeed in drawing our attention to shared cognition as a necessary element of collective behavior.

He outlines the brief history of ethnic antagonisms that led to the crimes, and explains why the Clinton Administration, the United Nations (including current U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan), and the former colonial powers in Africa (such as France) all refused to intervene to halt the butchery. The French even took steps to keep it going. Gourevitch is particularly good at placing the genocide into a context that shows why our political leaders were too paralyzed to get involved and risk doing anything to save lives. Basically, it seems to come down to the fact that Rwanda has no oil, the victims were black, and the timing was all wrong (U.S. Rangers had just been shot to death and dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia only weeks earlier). Misc:  Gourevitch excoriates the French for supporting the Hutus for essentially racist reasons; the international relief agencies, which he characterizes as largely devoid of moral courage; and the surrounding countries that preyed on the millions of refugees, many fleeing the consequences of their part in the killings. Gourevitch wants to know WHAT happened. He also describes the HOW. For years it was evident to the West--and most particularly to France and Belgium--that Hutu factions were gathering their strength to strike at the Tutsi minority. Every day Hutu radio stations ran violent anti-Tutsi propaganda, in which Tutsis and any moderate Hutus who were not interested in killing them were warned to prepare to die. When the killing began, it was simply the next logical step in a process that had long been underway. The case seems impossible to refute--indeed, the UN's internal investigation which published its report in December 1999 does NOT refute--that the genocide was both broadly predictable, and could have been ameliorated, if not altogether stopped, by effective international intervention. Apparently criticized by Howard French in <i>A Continent for the Taking</i> for promoting a good-bad stereotypicalism among U.S. policymakers on genocide, helping them justify nonintervention. But reviewers contradict that, unless the shared analysis is that the Rwandan genocide exhibited mass voluntary participation, thus not purely an elite manipulation. <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/sneaks/1998/09/22sneaks.html">Review</a>: "Gourevitch is particularly adept at systematically debunking the myths, widely circulated in the Western press, that shaped our early perceptions of what was happening in Rwanda: that the conflict was an age-old struggle between two distinct peoples bent on annihilating each other ...." <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/04/reviews/981004.04soyinkt.html">Review</a>: Shows that "the massacres were meticulously planned and ruthlessly executed by the state, but the instrumentation was widespread and criminality thus collectivized."

For Hayner, truth commissions are "official [and short-term] bodies set up to investigate and report on a pattern of past human rights abuses" (p. 5). At their best, they present an account of the nature and causes of past repression, contribute to legal justice, offer respect to victims, and recommend reforms.

Review (in <i>Am J Int Law</i>, 95, 257-260, available through UW Libraries electronic journals): "... addresses one of the many barriers to effective remedies: the uncoordinated and inconsistent jurisprudence of the various international institutions that offer redress to victims of human rights abuses. She notes that the underlying norms themselves have become more settled and more widely accepted, and that the time is consequently ripe for an analysis of the theory and practice of human rights remedies. ... By comparing the work of multiple organizations on similar issues, Shelton is able to demonstrate that most have taken unnecessarily narrow views of one or more aspects of their mandates. With this empirical analysis as a foundation, she argues persuasively for a more flexible interpretation of their remedial options. ... determining an appropriate level of compensation is complicated by the fact that holding the state responsible forces all members of society to share the burden of an award of damages. Shelton urges, however, that redress be viewed as of benefit to all of society-and that the shared cost is therefore well worth the price-because the ultimate effect is to deter future abuses and to further the rule of law. ... The valuable lessons Shelton draws are mere starting points for the gargantuan task still facing those in the international community who seek meaningful remedies for victims of human rights abuses. ... sometimes jumps between topics and repeats itself as the same issues recur in different contexts. Moreover, having organized and analyzed such a wide swath of material, more of Shelton's own observations and insights would have been welcome."</td><td>4</td></tr>

Their testimonies are supplemented by information from official, <i>samizdat</i>, and even several Western publications.

Solzhenitsyn departs regularly from the prisoners' journey for substantial essays on the evolution, psychology and sociology of the Gulag country." Author's explanation was: "The ideology's 'spiritual baseness,' its lack of 'religious and moral principles,' caused and justified the evil-doing. ... the anti-Stalinist, oppositionist ideas of Medvedev and others derive from a very different historical perspective, one that views the great terror as a repulsive betrayal of the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist-Leninist ideals."</td><td>3</td></tr>

He shows that the impetus for mass killing usually originates from a relatively small group of powerful leaders and is often carried out without the active support of broader society. ... defines mass killing broadly as the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants, using the criteria of 50,000 or more deaths within five years .... ... attempts to prevent mass killing should focus on disarming and removing from power the leaders and small groups responsible for instigating and organizing the killing." Review: "Unable to handle these conflicts in an effective manner, diplomats and leaders became defensive and began to blame their failures on the nature of the conflict itself. ... '... It is gut, it is hatred; it's not for any set of values or purposes; it just goes on. And that kind of warfare is most difficult to bring to a halt.' ... a view that leaves little hope that such atrocities can be prevented in the future. In his excellent book, ...
