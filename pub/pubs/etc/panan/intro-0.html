<h2>Panlingual Annotation</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>The issue</h4>
<p>An ideal system of universal meaning representation arguably has 6 functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expressiveness</li>
<li>Panlinguality</li>
<li>Efficiency of human production</li>
<li>Efficiency of automatic production</li>
<li>Efficiency of human consumption</li>
<li>Efficiency of automatic consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>Natural language has expressiveness and efficiency of human production and consumption, but is weak on the other three functionalities. NLP engineering aims to remedy one or more of these weaknesses. As of now, the weakness in panlinguality is so great that, for practical purposes, in most natural languages that possess writing systems (<a href="http://www.ogmios.org/117.htm">about 2000</a>) there is automatic production and consumption of text (thanks to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">Unicode standard</a>), but no automatic production or consumption of meaning. If a useful system of meaning representation were to be panlingual by design, how much expressiveness and human efficiency would it need to sacrifice?</p>
<h4>The idea</h4>
<p>Consider a system of "panlingual annotation". This is a system that represents only limited meanings. It has a natural-language-independent semantic grammar and lexicon, defined by a standardization process with broad expert and end-user collaboration (a "panlingual annotation semantics", or PAS). The lexicon contains an agreed list of primitive concepts. The grammar contains an agreed body of rules for the formulation of statements. The PAS defines what meanings can be expressed, but not the lexicon, morphology, or syntax for their expression by humans or to humans. Humans interact with the system via natural-language interfaces (NLIs), one (or more) for each natural language. No central authority or standardization process defines the NLIs, since each NLI operates only on expressions in the PAS and is thus not affected by any design features of any other NLIs. Input and output take place in a natural-language standard that is defined so as to permit PAS-unambiguous input and output. NLI designers may also provide other language-specific features, such as probabilistic parsers and probabilistic generators for natural-language expressions, checking software, authoring-support software, and training resources.</p>
<h4>Incremental development</h4>
<p>Panlingual annotation can be developed incrementally, for concept testing and refinement at low cost. Incrementalism can be implemented on three dimensions: panlinguality, expressiveness, and collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>An initial system can be equipped with NLIs for a few languages, exemplifying languages of distinct morphological, syntactic, and semantic types and with diverse linguistic resource wealths. NLIs for additional languages can be added incrementally.</li>
<li>An initial system can permit only entity identification and classification ("tagging"). More operations can be added incrementally.</li>
<li>An initial system can rely on impressionistic inspection of corpora to reveal facts about the demand for expressiveness. Participation by experts and end-users from diverse language communities can be added incrementally.</li>
</ul>
