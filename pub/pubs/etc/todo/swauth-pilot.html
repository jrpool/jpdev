<h2>Mass Semantic Authoring Pilot Study</h2>

<p>My proposal, "Mass Semantic Authoring" (<cite><a href="http://utilika.org/pubs/etc/todo/swauth.html">http://utilika.org/pubs/etc/todo/swauth.html</a></cite>), includes a pilot study. This is a summary of its requirements.</p>

<p>The pilot study is an analysis of existing data produced in the course of the operation of the Open Directory Project (ODP).</p>

<p>The data are the records of the ODP about URL submissions. It is believed that the record of each submission includes the submitted URL, the ODP subject category asserted by the submitter to be most appropriate for the URL, the decision on whether to include the URL in the Open Directory, if that decision is positive the decision on which category to assign to the URL, and other facts. There are expected to be records of roughly 4,000,000 submissions and 3,000,000 acceptances. There are currently about 600,000 ODP subject categories.</p>

<p>Access to the data will apparently require the cooperation of ODP (and perhaps its sponsor, AOL Netscape).</p>

<p>The main result to be determined is the reclassified URLs as a fraction of all accepted submissions. This is an approximation of the rate at which Web authors who use a controlled lexicon to classify their documents do so incorrectly. Additional results to be determined are (1) the determinants of author error (such as because of adversarial classification by authors), (2) the estimated rate of reclassification for reasons other than author error, (3) the corrected estimate of the rate of author error, (4) the distribution of severities of author errors, (5) the predominant types of author error, and (6) the hypothesized preventive measures that could efficiently decrease the author error rate.</p>

<p>The steps in the study are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review of literature.</li>
<li>Review of rights and contacts.</li>
<li>Inquiry and negotiation for access to data.</li>
<li>Design and execution of analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>The proposal discusses alternative study designs if access to the ODP data is impossible.</p>
