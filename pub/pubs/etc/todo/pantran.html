<h3><a id="ques">The Question</a></h3>

<p>Can controlled natural languages make fully automatic panlingual translation practical?</p>

<p>Panlingual translation is translation from every language into every other language. If the translation is fully automatic, it is good enough not to require post-editing. In other words, when the input is grammatical, coherent, and meaningful, the output is, too, and the output is also equivalent to the input semantically (possibly construed to include pragmatically).</p>

<p>Fully automatic translation, even between only two richly corpus-endowed and heavily analyzed natural languages, is not feasible now, and it is arguably infeasible in principle because of translingually discordant semantic repertoires and ambiguities. However, what would happen if the discourses to be translated were always encoded in controlled natural languages rather than ordinary natural languages? Would fully automatic translation among languages, and even among all languages, then be feasible? If so, would a system that performs such translation ("panlingual controlled translation") have practical applications?</p>

<h3><a id="known">Current Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>Whether a system of panlingual controlled translation would have practical applications depends in part on the demand for fully automatic, high-quality panlingual translation among (uncontrolled) natural languages. The translation market has been estimated to have an exchange value of roughly $13 billion per year as of 2007, with approximate translations "sometimes" considered sufficient (<cite>Walter 2003</cite>). High-quality translation is demanded when the content's precision is critical, such as when medical or legal documentation is translated (<cite>Vertan 2003, p. 2</cite>). Some organizations with a worldwide governmental constituency advocate the maintenance of the world's linguistic diversity, implying a continuing potential demand for translation among all currently existing languages, not only "major" ones (e.g., <cite><a href="http://www.unesco.org/education/imld2006">http://www.unesco.org/education/imld2006</a></cite>). Other organizations advocate universal access to classes of information, such as on science, health, and human rights, implying a need for translation into all languages from languages of publication (e.g., <cite><a href="http://www.plos.org/oa/index.html">http://www.plos.org/oa/index.html</a></cite>).</p>

<p>The practicality of panlingual controlled translation would depend also on its costs. These include the costs of system development, the costs of extension to additional domains, the costs of extension to additional languages, the costs of content production (writing) in controlled languages compared with ordinary languages, and the costs of content consumption (reading) in controlled languages. For example, can a literate fluent reader of Hausa read in controlled Hausa as fast as in literary Hausa, and how much training does such a person require?</p>

<p>No project attempting to implement panlingual controlled translation has been discovered, but a few projects have implemented translation from, to, or between controlled natural languages. The most significant effort to translate between controlled natural languages appears to be Webtran (<cite>Lehtola 1999, 2004</cite>). It is based on the parallel multilingual declaration of lexical entries, lexical rules, and optional dependency trees. Webtran's design is nondirectional, permitting translation from any of the defined languages into any of the others. The system has been used industrially to produce multilingual product catalogs, with controlled languages based on Swedish and Finnish and some "tentative tests" on Estonian, French, and English. Ideally, the translation rules are comprehensive enough, and the controlled languages are valid enough sublanguages, that the output texts are ready for presentation to users of an interactive catalog application, but in actual use some post-editing is required (<cite>Jaaranen 2000, p. 8</cite>). The system has been implemented for one additional commercial domain, vacation real-estate rentals, and in that context it was estimated that each additional domain requires about 4 person-months and each additional language within any particular domain requires about 3 person-months of development effort (<cite>Lehtola 2003, p. 6</cite>). This extension, however, was somewhat minor, from a catalog of clothing products to a catalog of real-estate rental products. The Webtran developers have not estimated the development effort for a major extension, such as to reviews of motion pictures, debates on international relations, or descriptions of diseases and their treatments. Webtran is rare in its development of a family of parallel controlled natural languages. With rare exceptions (e.g., <cite>Sowa 2004</cite>), controlled-language projects are based on a single natural language and don't anticipate multilingual extensions (<cite>Pool 2006</cite>).</p>

<p>Other than the Webtran project, research on translation among controlled natural languages is rare and does not disclose data on implementation costs. A conference titled "Controlled Language Translation" (<cite><a href="http://www.eamt.org/eamt-claw03/">http://www.eamt.org/eamt-claw03/</a></cite>) took place in 2003, but none of the 23 papers delivered there reported empirical research on translation among controlled languages. There were only allusions to this concept (<cite>Power 2003</cite>, <cite>Vertan 2003</cite>).</p>

<p>Research on translation from or to controlled natural languages has also produced little knowledge from which implementation costs for panlingual controlled translation could be inferred. Controlled languages have been used as interlinguas for machine translation between pairs (or larger sets) of full natural languages, and also as authoring languages for documents to be translated. Interlinguas, however, are usually machine-oriented meaning representation systems, such as Lexical Conceptual Structure and Text Meaning Representation (<cite>Trujillo 1999, pp. 167-201</cite>), not controlled natural languages. One exception is the DLT system (<cite>Witkam 1983</cite>, <cite>Schubert 2004</cite>), but the project's development costs of about 10.5 million Dutch guilders, or about $3.5 million (<cite><a href="http://www.eventoj.hu/arkivo/eve-140.htm">http://www.eventoj.hu/arkivo/eve-140.htm</a></cite>), were expended mainly for natural-language analysis and generation, so we cannot infer the cost of implementing translation between this and other controlled natural languages. Projects that have used controlled natural languages for the authoring of texts to be translated, such as KANT Controlled English, Controlled Modern Greek, and ScaniaSwedish, have not published development or operation costs.</p>

<p>One estimate of the operation costs of controlled natural languages has been published on the basis of the WYSIWYM project. Although translation was not the purpose, end-user authoring in a controlled natural language was required, and the effort required for this authoring was estimated as about 5 times as great as the effort to write the equivalent content in a natural language (<cite>Power 2003, pp. 6-7</cite>).</p>

<p>It is possible that controlled languages can be substantially less elaborate that natural languages without substantial loss of functionality, and if so then the cost of implementing controlled-language translation systems may likewise be substantially lower than the cost of implementing natural-language translation systems. It has been asserted that a small set of syntactic constructions can cover the vast majority of statements that people wish to make (Berners-Lee 2001). It has also been asserted that a language with a lexicon of 750 to 2,000 words can express the contents of any narrative literature (Betts 2003, p. 3).

<p>All known projects aiming at translation among indefinitely many languages rely exclusively on human translators. Among these are projects to translate the numbers from 1 to 10, currently with over 5000 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.zompist.com/numbers.shtml">http://www.zompist.com/numbers.shtml</a></cite>); to translate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, currently with 365 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/navigate/alpha.htm">http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/navigate/alpha.htm</a></cite>); to compile a panlingual dictionary, currently with about 200 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.wiktionary.org">http://www.wiktionary.org</a></cite>); to translate the interface of the Google search engine, currently with 152 languages (<cite><a href="http://services.google.com/tcbin/tc.py?cmd=status">http://services.google.com/tcbin/tc.py?cmd=status</a></cite>); to compile a panlingual locale database, currently with 121 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/summary/root.html">http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/summary/root.html</a></cite>); to translate the Open Directory Project's subject headings, currently with 78 languages (<cite><a href="http://dmoz.org/world.html">http://dmoz.org/world.html</a></cite>); to translate the interface of the Plone content-management system, currently with 51 languages (<cite><a href="http://plone.org/development/teams/i18n/existing-translations">http://plone.org/development/teams/i18n/existing-translations</a></cite>); to construct and coordinate WordNet lexical databases, currently with 39 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/wordnet_table.htm">http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/wordnet_table.htm</a></cite>); to translate the interface of the LiveJournal diary system, currently with 37 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/translate/">http://www.livejournal.com/translate/</a></cite>); to translate the Dewey Decimal Classification, currently with more than 30 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.oclc.org/dewey/about/translations/default.htm">http://www.oclc.org/dewey/about/translations/default.htm</a></cite>); to translate the Dublin Core Element Set Reference Description, currently with 27 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/resources/translations/">http://www.dublincore.org/resources/translations/</a></cite> and <cite><a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/languages/index.shtml">http://dublincore.org/groups/languages/index.shtml</a></cite>); and to create a system multilingually mapping subject headings, currently with 3 languages (<cite><a href="http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr517/04-05-wt2/projects/MACS/index.html">http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr517/04-05-wt2/projects/MACS/index.html</a></cite>).</p>

<h3><a id="cont">Contribution</a></h3>

<p>Given the meager knowledge about the feasibility and practical applicability of panlingual controlled translation, it appears that the best way to acquire more such knowledge is to conduct a pilot development and utilization study that measures resources consumed and results produced.</p>

<p>The project proposed here would develop the world's first prototype of a system of panlingual controlled translation. It would be designed as a working system, with Web-based development and user interfaces. Persons not affiliated with the project would be invited to use it. Transactional and survey data would be collected from users. The analysis of the data would produce knowledge about the answer to the research question.</p>

<p>The project would consist of two components. The first would develop a panlingual lexical resource. The second would use that resource to build and test a prototype panlingual translation system. The lexical resource would be independently available to the public for use in other projects, as well.</p>

<h3><a id="lexres">Lexical Resource</a></h3>

<p>The panlingual lexical resource ("PanLex") is a database that records facts about the equivalences among lexemes in languages.</p>

<p>The facts recorded in PanLex are assertions. Each assertion says that a lexeme in one language is equivalent to a lexeme in another language. An assertion contains these fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Asserter</li>
<li>Authority 0</li>
<li>Language 0</li>
<li>Lexeme 0</li>
<li>Index 0</li>
<li>Class 0</li>
<li>Authority 1</li>
<li>Language 1</li>
<li>Lexeme 1</li>
<li>Index 1</li>
<li>Class 1</li>
<li>Gloss</li>
</ul>

<p>The authority fields are optional and permit the asserter to identify for each language an authority on which the asserter relied in making the assertion.</p>

<p>The language fields identify the language varieties. A possible code for representing their values is a combination of the ISO 639-2 code (<cite><a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html</a></cite>) and a variety code. The variety code would permit controlled varieties to be treated as varieties of the languages on which they are based. Additional codes could be provided for languages not based on natural languages or based on several of them.</p>

<p>The index fields are optional and permit the differentiation of a lexeme from other homographs in the language's lexicon.</p>

<p>The class fields are optional and permit the asserter to assign parts of speech or other class memberships to the lexemes.</p>

<p>The gloss field permits the asserter to make any free-text remark in any language to explain or qualify the assertion.</p>

<p>PanLex derives an initial body of assertions from existing compilations of translingual lexical equivalences. These include the Wiktionary, WordNet, Dewey Decimal, and Open Directory resources referenced above, as well as bilingual dictionaries and translation lexicons based on parallel corpora.</p>

<p>PanLex provides reasoning features operating on the data. For example, PanLex can discover asserted equivalences based on chains of assertions, inconsistencies among assertions within or across asserters, and multilingual equivalence sets.</p>

<p>PanLex provides a Web-based user interface, human-translated into multiple languages, for the submission, modification, deletion, and analysis of assertions. It is accessible from minimal as well as feature-rich browsers.</p>

<p>PanLex also provides a programmatic interface so that automated agents can query it efficiently.</p>

<p>PanLex offers editorial services based on the above features. It permits an asserter to register authorities (including by reference to authorities already registered by other asserters) and assign identifiers to them, to be used in the authority fields. It permits an asserter to initiate a language variety by populating its records with equivalences to an existing variety. It can maintain records of asserters, users, and their preferences. With these records, it can notify asserters and users of discovered inconsistencies. It can permit users to record their relative levels of trust in asserters and use those records to resolve inconsistencies when responding to those users' queries. It maintains and discloses statistics on lexemes, languages, asserters, and queries. It can notify qualified asserters of queries that have failed for lack of applicable assertions.</p>

<h3><a id="transys">Translation System</a></h3>

<p>The translation system is limited to controlled natural languages. In particular, it exhibits:</p>

<ul>
<li>complete interlingual equivalence</li>
<li>complete symmetric semantic functionality</li>
<li>incomplete expressivity</li>
<li>incomplete fidelity</li>
</ul>

<p>In a system with complete interlingual equivalence, the sets of valid denotations that the controlled languages can represent are equivalent. For each denotation that one language can represent, there is a corresponding denotation that each other language can represent. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that there is simply a single set of valid denotations for the entire system, and each controlled language can represent all and only the denotations in that set. In other words, all the controlled natural languages can express the same set of meanings and none of them can express any meanings beyond that set.</p>

<p>Each controlled language has a set of valid expressions, and, if the system has complete symmetric semantic functionality, then each expression represents exactly one of the valid denotations, and each denotation is reverse-mapped to (represented by) each expression that represents it. In other words, every valid expression in every controlled language must be unambiguous, but synonymy is possible. For example, it may be that the expression "Did the dog bite the man?" has the same meaning as "Was the man bitten by the dog?", but the sentence "Sand surfaces" may not mean both "Rub surfaces with sandpaper, please" and "Sand comes to the surface". The prohibition on ambiguity does not extend to vagueness (e.g., "expensive") or underspecification (e.g., "a person" being possibly "a child" and possibly "an adult"). Still, such controlled natural languages are qualitatively distinct from natural languages, because the latter exhibit pervasive ambiguity (<cite>Wasow 2003</cite>), which the former exclude.</p>

<p>Complying with these first two requirements is advantageous for a panlingual translation system. With thousands of natural languages, it would be impractical to define and test the system centrally. The task of defining the component of the system for each particular natural language must, for practicality, be assigned to a person or team fluent in that language. Complete interlingual equivalence makes this decentralization possible. The set of valid denotations acts as an interface, or specification, and any controlled language that complies with it is interoperable with the others, regardless of how it is implemented. Complete symmetric semantic functionality allows translation to occur without reliance on the input expression, once that expression has been mapped to its denotation. That denotation represents the result of strategic generation (deciding what to say) and becomes the source for tactical generation (deciding how to say it) into the target language. So, if there are 5,000 languages in the system, each language needs to interact with the single semantic specification, and there are 5,000 translation models to develop. Otherwise, the system would resemble a semantic-transfer translation system, in which a correct translation requires a special model that directionally maps between some types of expressions in a pair of languages to accomplish strategic generation. This would necessitate about 25 million pairwise translation models.</p>

<p>In a system with incomplete expressivity, the set of valid denotations is not as large as the union of the sets of valid denotations for all natural languages. In other words, some natural languages can express some meanings that the controlled languages in the system cannot express. The hypothesis that this must be true of a practical system of panlingual controlled translation arises from two hunches. One is that expressivity is costly, and at least some expressivity costs more to implement than it is worth, so excluding such too-costly expressivity makes any system a better deal. The other is that natural languages differ in the meanings they can routinely express, and users of a system of panlingual translation do not expect it to translate meanings that can be routinely expressed in only a small fraction of the participating languages.</p>

<p>In a system with incomplete fidelity, at least some controlled natural languages have at least some valid expressions that in the corresponding natural languages either are not valid expressions or have denotations differing from the denotations of those expressions in the controlled languages. In other words, some controlled languages permit expressions that aren't grammatical in the base languages, or, if grammatical, have meanings in the base languages different from their meanings in the controlled languages. The hypothesis that this must be true of a practical system arises from two intuitions. One is that the pervasive ambiguity of natural languages would make it difficult to define a controlled language whose expressions are all unambiguous when used in the base language. The other is that the global set of valid denotations, if it has been equitably defined, must be alien in some ways to each natural language, and users of a controlled language are likely to prefer that it exhibit some regularities and denotational parallelisms that are incompatible with a prohibition on all unnatural expressions.</p>

<p>The incompleteness of expressivity and fidelity creates a design space with these dimensions, and the most economical strategy for exploring that space is to begin near the origin. In other words, the study begins with a radically restricted expressivity and with radically limited fidelity. The study aims for an initial set of denotations that covers some domain or domains in which the demand for panlingual translation is believed to be great and in which the semantic complexity appears to be low. Further development is expected to require new investments that yield gradually decreasing rates of return, until it is no longer practical to improve expressiveness or fidelity.</p>

<p>This initial high-value/low-complexity use case makes it possible for the system to utilize controlled languages that differ from one another almost purely in their lexicons. In the extreme case, each initial controlled language is a lexicon of content lexemes and operators that, for input, lend themselves to a universal (shared) form-based interface differing only in language-specific operators. The system can then evolve so that controlled languages acquire more high-fidelity morphosyntactic rules. This evolution can leave, as a byproduct, input dialects of the same controlled language that differ in the locus of initiative, which different users can select to match their skills and styles. Thus, one dialect might guide the user interactively and prevent any invalid expressions, while another dialect is to be written with only post-submission validation.</p>

<p>The initial emphasis, then, is on how useful the denotations are, not on how familiar the languages are (cf. <cite>Etzioni 1996, p. 2</cite>). This sequencing permits the usefulness to motivate demand for greater usability. In a panlingual system, such demand must be part of the development, since those expressing the demand will need to participate in the elaboration of the system for the languages that they know. In fact, the ability to get one's native language included in a nominally panlingual system can be expected to provide motivation for some volunteers, as observed in the case of many projects that use volunteer effort in the multilingualization of software and user interfaces. In a real-world implementation, controlled languages could be expected to vary in fidelity: Widely used ones might enjoy more investment and thereby acquire more fidelity.</p>

<p>The translation system is a prototype, for the evaluation of user responses. In the real world such a system would also be a multiagent social system. The set of valid denotations would be a world semantic standard adopted and maintained in a process with constituents having participatory rights. Changes in the semantic standard would affect all controlled languages. Changes in any controlled language would not directly impact other languages, but would affect the system's use by the controlled language's users and thereby affect the system's resources, indirectly increasing or decreasing the value of the system to all its users. Observations and measurements that would help forecast the operation of such a multiagent system are an additional ingredient of the study. The initial semantic standard is defined as a hypothesis about a standard that a collaborative standardization activity might produce. Thus, it preferentially selects concepts with wide cross-lingual lexical representation and hypothetically quasi-universal operators.</p>

<p>The prototype translation system is tested initially on a high-demand domain that can be covered with a simple set of denotations. Among the domains that might be candidates are:</p>

<ul>
<li>information-resource description</li>
<li>common-sense knowledge</li>
<li>personal relations</li>
<li>consumer health</li>
<li>human rights</li>
</ul>

<p class="l">The choice of domains depends on public interest, interest among potential partner institutions, the existence of massively multilingual corpora and resources, and the semantic simplicity of discourses that the domains minimally require. The choice among domains also affects the kinds of translingual incompatibilities that must be resolved in the semantic standardization process. For example, the domain of personal relations exhibits translingual differences in categories of consanguines, affines, body types, ethnicities, and religions.</p>

<p>In addition to at least one substantive domain, the system must cover the domain of its own operation (the "operational domain"). This includes meanings that must be expressable by designers and users of the system itself, such as user instructions, complaints, and suggestions. This permits the system to eat its own dogfood.</p>

<p>One element of the prototype standard is a lexicon, defined in PanLex as that of a controlled interlingua.</p>

<p>The system includes a tool for the specification of controlled natural languages. The tool initially has the ability to define grammars and lexicons that can parse expressions into the semantic standard's set of valid denotations, and generate expressions from those denotations. For this purpose, the study relies on the Grammar Matrix (<cite><a href="http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/">http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/</a></cite>) project's algorithms and its knowledge base of hypothesized linguistic universals and language types. The specification tool takes morphosyntactic and semantic parameter values as input, and automatically produces a parsing and generating grammar as output. The parameter values and lexicon are elicited with a version of the Grammar Matrix Web configuration form (<cite><a href="http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/modules.html">http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/modules.html</a></cite>). The lexicon's lexemes are assumed to have been previously defined in PanLex with equivalences to the controlled interlingua, and all necessary lexical facts are assumed to be represented in the lexeme classes recorded in PanLex, with the rules governing the classes specified in the input to the specification tool. The questions and instructions on the configuration form belong to the operational domain. This implies that, as soon as the form has been completed, the resulting grammar and lexicon can generate the form itself in the controlled language that has just been added to the system.</p>

<p>The formalism used by the controlled-language components for the representation of denotations is Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). Distinct MRS representations arise only from distinct expressions. For example, some natural languages express declarative and polar interrogative sentences identically, as in "you are married" = "are you married?" (<cite><a href="http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/dryer/dryer/DryerWalsPolarQNoMap.pdf">http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/dryer/dryer/DryerWalsPolarQNoMap.pdf</a></cite>), so, if the semantic standard distinguishes these denotation types, then controlled varieties of those languages must also use distinct expressions for them.</p>

<p>The study uses the specification tool to define an initial batch of controlled languages. A reasonable set of candidates for the base languages is the set of 40 languages for which initial grammars have already been produced in the Grammar Matrix project (<cite><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Main/LanguagesList">http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Main/LanguagesList</a></cite>).

<p>The translation system includes a progressive interface for the use of controlled languages. For beginners, the interface assumes no knowledge of the languages and offers users form-based controls for the composition of expressions. The composed expressions are displayed (cf. <cite><a href="http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/projects/WYSIWYM/wysiwym.html">http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/projects/WYSIWYM/wysiwym.html</a></cite>), and users may progress toward direct entry of expressions as they acquire competence. The elements of this interface are included in the operational domain.</p>

<p>The translation system also includes Internet services that allow users to use, and participate in extending, the system. The services may include publication and messaging, where a document or message is composed in a single controlled language and disseminated or delivered in any demanded controlled language. The study routinely surveys users to elicit ratings and comments. An important class of comments is suggestions for the semantic elaboration of the system. This feature requires that users be able to use a controlled language to express a desire to express denotations that they cannot express with the controlled language. The capability for this kind of bootstrapping can be based on compositional meanings and slots fillable with expressions quoted from natural languages.</p>

<h3><a id="pubs">Publications</a></h3>

<p>Once PanLex has been deployed, a publication announcing and describing it can help create public awareness, which will facilitate the recruitment of volunteers. After some use, a subsequent publication can describe the lessons learned, revisions made, and future promise of PanLex, as well as summarizing the research on a panlingual controlled translation system that is to be based on it.</p>

<p>If and when the development of the translation system produces results of novelty and interest, at least one publication would appropriately introduce the theory and design of the system, without empirical results, since the idea that panlingual translation might be a practical goal will be unfamiliar and dubious to most potentially interested readers, and explaining the rationale of the project will involve enough details to fill a report.</p>

<p>Since the idea of panlingual translation is futuristic and could fascinate a nonspecialist public, a more popular version of the above publication, as a concept article, could usefully be published in a periodical that appeals to an interdisciplinary technical audience.</p>

<p>If the initial system covers a single substantive domain, an article describing the achievements of the system in facilitating multilingual communication in that domain would be a coherent publication.</p>

<p>Another appropriate publication is a report describing the bootstrapping of the system for the collaborative elaboration of the system itself.</p>
