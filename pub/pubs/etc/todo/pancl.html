<h3><a name="ques">The Question</a></h3>

<p>How easily can ordinary Web authors semantically annotate content?</p>

<p>The Semantic Web is one of the few most influential ideas about the world's information future, but its feasibility is debated, and the feature whose feasibility arouses the greatest skepticism is mass authorship.</p>

<p>Proponents assert that ordinary Web authors could use "off-the-shelf software for writing Semantic Web pages" (i.e. for representing page content as RDF using OWL ontologies) and imply that such software would make the writing task easy enough to motivate ordinary Web authors to do so (Berners-Lee 2001).</p>

<p>Skeptics assert that even the most user-friendly software would spare ordinary Web authors only the tedium of authorship management, but would still obligate them to use a formal representation language and formally defined concepts to express meanings, and to learn how representations affect the results produced by reasoning algorithms. All this "requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer", and most Web authors would not be willing to undergo enough training to acquire this skill (Marshall 2003).</p>

<p>Even skeptics, however, say that the formally annotated fraction of the content of the Web is "increasing dramatically" (Shirky 2003), in a bottom-up way that does not respect the ontological and syntactic standardization envisioned for the Semantic Web. They forecast a highly annotated and partly machine-produced and -consumed Web, one that is less coherent than the Semantic Web prescription but is already in progress.</p>

<p>If the Web is on the way to becoming rich in semantically annotated content and rich also in automated agents reasoning with such content, human authors of at least some content will benefit by semantically annotating it, but how easily can they do so?</p>

<p>The Semantic Web vision calls for mass authorship of semantically annotated content, and that implies authorship by native speakers of hundreds of languages. If the "off-the-shelf software" uses a natural-language interface, it must be panlingual. When authors refer to ontologies published by others, if the definitions in those ontologies contain natural-language glosses that authors need to understand, those glosses must be accessible panlingually. Thus, answering the above question in a unilingual context would help assess the realism of the Semantic Web, but expanding the context to a multilingual one would improve the inference.</p>

<h3><a name="known">Current Knowledge</a></h3>

<p> Parts of DCMI's vocabulary exist in up to about 25 languages, and DCMI has a Localization and Internationalization Working Group that deals with the adaptation of the DCMI vocabulary to multiple languages, cultures, and domains, and with the global utilization of "local knowledge from a diversity of cultural contexts", but the  (). Its discussions are entirely in English, its concept definitions are explicated with English glosses, and the possibility that its concepts would be English-specific and difficult for those with other native languages to use does not arise in its discussions. Systematic usability testing is not conducted</p>
