<h2>Panlingual Controlled Translation Lexical Resource</h2>

<p>My proposal, "Panlingual Controlled Translation" (<cite><a href="http://utilika.org/pubs/etc/todo/pantran.html">http://utilika.org/pubs/etc/todo/pantran.html</a></cite>), includes, as its first component, a project to develop a panlingual lexical resource. This is a summary of its requirements.</p>

<p>The panlingual lexical resource ("PanLex") is a database that records facts about the equivalences among lexemes in languages.</p>

<p>The facts recorded in PanLex are assertions. Each assertion says that a lexeme in one language is equivalent to a lexeme in another language. An assertion contains these fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Asserter</li>
<li>Authority 0</li>
<li>Language 0</li>
<li>Lexeme 0</li>
<li>Index 0</li>
<li>Class 0</li>
<li>Authority 1</li>
<li>Language 1</li>
<li>Lexeme 1</li>
<li>Index 1</li>
<li>Class 1</li>
<li>Gloss</li>
</ul>

<p>PanLex derives an initial body of assertions from existing compilations of translingual lexical equivalences. These include the Wiktionary, WordNet, Dewey Decimal, and Open Directory resources referenced above, as well as bilingual dictionaries and translation lexicons based on parallel corpora.</p>

<p>PanLex provides reasoning features operating on the data. For example, PanLex can discover asserted equivalences based on chains of assertions, inconsistencies among assertions within or across asserters, and multilingual equivalence sets.</p>

<p>PanLex provides a Web-based user interface, human-translated into multiple languages, for the submission, modification, deletion, and analysis of assertions. It is accessible from minimal as well as feature-rich browsers.</p>

<p>PanLex also provides a programmatic interface so that automated agents can query it efficiently.</p>

<p>PanLex offers editorial services based on the above features. It permits an asserter to register authorities (including by reference to authorities already registered by other asserters) and assign identifiers to them, to be used in the authority fields. It permits an asserter to initiate a language variety by populating its records with equivalences to an existing variety. It can maintain records of asserters, users, and their preferences. With these records, it can notify asserters and users of discovered inconsistencies. It can permit users to record their relative levels of trust in asserters and use those records to resolve inconsistencies when responding to those users' queries. It maintains and discloses statistics on lexemes, languages, asserters, and queries. It can notify qualified asserters of queries that have failed for lack of applicable assertions.</p>
