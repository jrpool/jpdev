<h3>Objectives</h3>
<blockquote>the creation of a semantic representation system (<cite>Reeder 2004, p. 1</cite>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>to <em>produce a practical</em>, commonly-shared system for representing the information conveyed by a text, or <em>interlingua</em> (<cite>IAMTC 2004, "Home"</cite>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>developing and testing a well-defined, well-motivated, and practical level of representation that captures semantic information from natural language text (<cite>IAMTC 2004, "Goals"</cite>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The development of six <em>semantically-annotated bilingual corpora</em> that pair English texts with corresponding text in Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, French, and Korean. <cite>Reeder 2004, p. 2</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>The semantically annotated corpora will be useful for MT development and other natural language processing applications. <cite>Reeder 2004, p. 2</cite></blockquote>
<h3>Contributions</h3>
<blockquote>The scientific interest of this research lies in the <em>definition</em> and annotation <em>feasibility testing</em> of a level of semantic representation for natural language text--the interlingua representation--that captures important aspects of the meaning of different natural languages. To date, no such level of representation has been defined complete with an associated <em>annotated corpus</em> of any size. As a result, corpora have been annotated at a relatively shallow (semantics-free) level, forcing NLP researchers to choose between shallow approaches and hand-crafted approaches, each having its own set of problems. <cite>Dorr/Farwell 2004, p. 6</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>This research will help provide the basis for a <em>paradigmatic shift</em> in natural language processing (NLP), enabling corpus-based research as well as linguistic research into language-independent meaning representations in applications such as machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and information retrieval. <cite>IAMTC 2004, "Goals"</cite>)</blockquote>
