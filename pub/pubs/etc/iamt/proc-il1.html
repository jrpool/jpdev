<h3>IL1</h3>
<h4>Who does what</h4>
<blockquote>In progressing from IL0 to IL1, annotators select <em>semantic terms</em> to represent the <em>nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs</em> present in each sentence.  These terms are represented in the 10,000-node Omega ontology. ... To create IL1 from the IL0 representation, annotators use Tiamat .... <cite>Reeder 2004, pp. 3-4</cite></blockquote>
<p>An annotator doesn't change any dependency tree's structure.</p>
<p>An annotator doesn't change any node's grammatical category.</p>
<p>An annotator:</p>
<ul>
<li>labels each node marked as a common noun, verb, adjective, or adverb with at least 1 concept from the ontology.</li>
<li>labels each child of each verb with exactly 1 thematic role (or "none").</li>
</ul>
<h4>IL0 &#x2192; IL1 Manual</h4>
<p>Does not presuppose linguistic expertise. Examples:</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>... lexical items out of context can have several different meanings: "bank" can refer to a financial institution, the edge of a river, the act of putting money into a bank, or to the act of a pilot turning an airplane to the left or right. When you look at a word in context, you should be able to figure out which meaning is in play.</blockquote>
<blockquote>By "reasonable set of concepts" we mean concepts that would reasonably answer somebody's question, "What kind of event was that?" or "What kind of object is that?" So, if you are looking at concepts like "object" or "event" or "non-agentive motion event" you are looking at too high a level in the ontology (unless, of course, the lexical item itself is that vague--a word like "event" or "object").</blockquote>
