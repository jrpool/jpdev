<h1>STUDY CURRENTLY CLOSED</h1>

<h2>Participate in a Study of Ambiguity!</h2>

<h3>What?</h3>

<p>This is a study of ambiguity (multiple meanings), conducted at the University of Washington. I'm Jonathan Pool, and I'm investigating how people interpret ambiguous statements and how the meanings of such statements can be clarified. I hope to apply the results to the development of methods for more successful communication among people worldwide (across language barriers) and between humans and computers.</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>

<p>You are eligible to participate if you can read and write English.</p>

<h3>Where?</h3>

<p>I am conducting the study on the Web. You can participate anywhere, using a Web browser.</p>

<h3>When?</h3>

<p>Now! The study will end on Tuesday, 13 March 2007, at 12:00 (12:00 noon), Pacific Daylight Time (19:00 UTC).</p>

<h3>How long?</h3>

<p>I estimate that your participation will last 25-40 minutes. When you click on "Next" below, you will be allowed 90 minutes to finish.</p>

<h3>What do I get?</h3>

<p>Participants are unpaid volunteers. By participating, you can contribute to knowledge about communication and understanding, suggest improvements in the study, and possibly learn something. (Exception: The first 20 participants who complete the study and report their identifiers to Amazon Mechanical Turk at http://www.mturk.com will receive a nominal fee and be eligible for a bonus for the most valuable comments.)</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>I have prepared a Participation Agreement. If you accept it, you can begin.</p>
