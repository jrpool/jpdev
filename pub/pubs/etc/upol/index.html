<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The idea of universal human rights has existed for at least two thousand years, but the idea of their universal enforcement entered the world's public discourse only 109 years ago. Within this relatively short time, the latter idea has assumed three concrete forms: criminal prohibitions on some human-rights violations, a world political institution (the United Nations Security Council) with the authority to stop such violations and arrest accused perpetrators, and a world judicial institution (the International Criminal Court) with the authority to try and punish such individuals, once captured.</p>

<p>This rapid development of enforcement institutions has been accompanied by a growth in the demand for their use. But their failures have been spectacular, with millions of persons suffering displacement, incarceration, rape, torture, maiming, and death in violation of the existing criminal prohibitions. The gap between the demand for and the supply of enforcement has led not only to agitation for more action, but also to proposals for the invention of new, more robust institutions.</p>

<p>Policing is the ingredient of universal human-rights crime control that is, by far, least robust. No universal police force exists, and any deployment of an ad hoc force requires action by the veto-constrained Security Council, followed by member states' voluntary provision of resources. While constituents expect urban police response to violent crime within minutes, the responses of this apparatus are measured in months and years, or simply do not occur. Human-rights crimes typically begin with conspiratorial cliques, so rapid police action can prevent or interdict them at relatively low cost. Depoliticized universal policing would foreseeably also be more predictable, impartial, and pragmatic. It is already popular among the world's population, though not among political influentials. Thus, we describe an action plan that begins with the mobilization of the public and ends with the deployment of the Universal Police.</p>

<h3>Universal Enforcement of Human Rights: The Idea</h3>

<p>Among the early “federalists” claimed as precursors of world law enforcement by Davies were the Achaeans, Dante, the Duc de Sully, Saint-Pierre, Rousseau, and Kant (Pugh, 2002, p. 98). William Penn and John Bellers in the 17th century advocated an international deterrent force (Pugh, 2002, p. 100). Waldstein (1899, p. 110) envisioned a “Court of Arbitration” with “an international army, and an international fleet, -- the police of the world’s highways”. In the 1930s, British and French influentials, including David Davies, Lord Gladstone, Lord Robert Cecil, Winston Churchill, and Clement Attlee (Pugh, 2002, p. 97).</p>

<h3>Editorial Notes</h3>

<p>See Chicago Council, p. 77: "... majorities in all countries favor most of the steps to strengthen the United Nations that figured in our questionnaire. Sixty percent of Americans, 59% of Chinese, 57% of Indians, and 75% of South Koreans favor giving the United Nations the power to regulate the international arms trade. The numbers in favor of having a standing UN peacekeeping force are similar: 72% of Americans, 62% of Chinese, 58% of Indians, and 68% of South Koreans. Perhaps most striking are the numbers in favor of giving the UN authority to go into countries to investigate violations of human rights (75% of Americans, 57% of Chinese, 54% of Indians, and 74% of South Koreans) and to create an international marshals service that could arrest leaders responsible for genocide (75% of Americans, 57% of Chinese, 57% of Indians, and 77% of South Koreans)."
