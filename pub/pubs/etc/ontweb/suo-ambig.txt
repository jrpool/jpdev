Graham,
   I think you are addressing in part a difficult issue that others have 
raised.  I believe we need to be very clear about distinguishing an 
ontology from a natural language lexicon.  Words in a lexicon can be 
ambiguous because humans use the same words in different ways, but terms in 
an ontology must have unique definitions.  We may map terms in an ontology 
to a lexicon but the two artifacts are distinct.
   This also is related to the discussion that is occurring about 
dictionary definitions.  The terms or labels we use in the SUO will just be 
markers to aid human understanding.  A computational system will not care 
ultimately if we have a term 'Action' or a term 'Foo' if the axioms 
associated with the symbol are the same.  Likewise, although evocative 
names for terms will be helpful, it is the logical definitions associated 
with the name that must be unambiguous.  That said, I support the proposal 
to use long and descriptive names for concepts.
