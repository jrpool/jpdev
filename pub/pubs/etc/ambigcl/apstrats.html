<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Controlled languages' designs vary in base-language compliance. In a purely compliant controlled language, every valid sentence is also a valid sentence in the base language.</p>

<p>A sentence that is valid in a controlled language and also in its base language may or may not have the same meaning in both languages. In general, the sentence tends to be unambiguous or less ambiguous in the controlled language. But its meaning in the controlled language may be its most likely meaning in the base language, one of its less likely meanings in the base language, or a meaning that it cannot have in the base language.</p>

<h3>Ambiguity Control in Attempto Controlled English</h3>

<p>Attempto Controlled English (ACE) causes utterances to be unambiguous by incorporating rules that make only one interpretation of each utterance valid. Some ACE rules exhibit a dominance of simplicity over naturality. For example, in any sentence that contains both coordination and negation, ACE applies negation first and coordination second. That simple rule conflicts with the prevailing rules applied in natural English, where negation is applied first when the subject is coordinated, but coordination is applied first when the complement is coordinated. To illustrate:</p>

<table summary="ACE Versus Natural English Rules" border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Sentence</th>
		<th>ACE Interpretation</th>
		<th>Natural Interpretation</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>John or Jane does not smoke</td>
		<td>John does not smoke or Jane does not smoke</td>
		<td>John does not smoke or Jane does not smoke</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>John does not have a brother or a sister</td>
		<td>John does not have a brother or does not have a sister</td>
		<td>It is not the case that John has a brother or has a sister</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>John and Jane do not smoke</td>
		<td>John does not smoke and Jane does not smoke</td>
		<td>John does not smoke and Jane does not smoke</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>John does not have a brother and a sister</td>
		<td>John does not have a brother and does not have a sister</td>
		<td>It is not the case that John has a brother and has a sister</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In its current version, ACE does not permit subject coordination, so the sentences that would be interpreted identically in ACE and natural English are invalid in ACE, leaving only the sentences that are interpreted differently in ACE and natural English.</p>

<p>A problem with ACE's choice of simplicity over naturality as a principle on which to base interpretation rules is that any refinement of ACE to make it more natural will also make it conflict with its prior version. Some sentences valid in both versions will be interpreted differently by the versions. To avoid this problem, ACE could have invalidated sentences until it is developed so as to interpret those sentences naturally. For example, it could have made "John does not have a brother or a sister" invalid. Users of ACE wanting to negate "John has a brother or a sister" would then not be tempted to misencode that idea in that way, and instead would be able to encode it as "John has no brother and no sister" or "John does not have a brother and does not have a sister", both of which have natural interpretations in ACE.</p>

<h3>Ambiguity Control in ClearTalk</h3>

<p>ClearTalk causes utterances to be unambiguous by incorporating rules that make only one interpretation of each utterance valid and by requiring ambiguity-preventing annotations. Some valid ClearTalk utterances are also valid in English, but the valid interpretations of those utterances in ClearTalk are not always the most likely interpretations of the same utterances in English. For example, ClearTalk incorporates the rule that every adverb in a sentence "by default" modifies the sentence's verb. This rule leads to the ClearTalk sentence "Bill usually dates Mary on weekends" being interpreted so that "usually" modifies "dates" (see section 3.23). In natural English, however, this sentence might, depending on the intonation, discourse context, and shared knowledge, be interpreted so that "usually" modifies "Bill", "dates", "Mary", or "on weekends".

<h3>Quantificational Ambiguity in English-Based Controlled Languages</h3>

<p>Each English-based controlled language has some strategy for dealing with the ambiguity of quantifiers in English. Consider the example of the indefinite article "a" as a noun determiner in two controlled languages.</p>

<p>In Attempto Controlled English, if the noun phrase is the complement of the copula "is", then the noun phrase is a predication applied to the subject and the determiner "a" is obligatory. "Seattle is a city" is valid, but "Seattle is city" and "Seattle is the city" are invalid. In any other context, a noun phrase must include a determiner, and if the determiner is "a" then the noun phrase is thereby designated as new information, i.e. it refers to an object that has not yet been referred to and thereby introduces that object into the discourse. Thus, in "The customer buys a sandwich" the customer is old information and the sandwich is new information, while in "A customer buys the sandwich" it is the opposite.</p>

<p>In ClearTalk, if the noun phrase is the subject of a sentence, "a" is a universal quantifier: It means "every". If the noun phrase is not the subject, "a" means "1".</p>

<p>These two controlled languages both admit sentences like "A student cheats", but they interpret such sentences differently. In ACE, this sentence means "Some student cheats", but in ClearTalk it means "Every student cheats". This sentence is ambiguous in natural English, and both of these meanings are possible there. Its validity in any controlled language creates a risk of misinterpretation. A controlled language could evade that risk by banning this sentence and prescribing for each of its meanings an encoding that is either not valid in natural English or unambiguous in natural English. Neither ACE nor ClearTalk does this.</p>

<h3>Lexical Ambiguity Prevention in Controlled Languages</h3>

<p>Controlled languages that prevent lexical ambiguity typically do so by incorporating lexicons with each lexeme being monosemic and prohibiting lexemes that are not in the lexicons (or requiring that such lexemes be expressly declared, consistently with the lexicons, before being used).</p>

<p>As an example, ASD Simplified Technical English contains a lexicon that defines the verb "follow" as meaning the opposite of "precede". The "obey" sense of "follow" is, therefore, not licensed in ASDSTE. In natural English, the sentence "In the manual, the instructions follow the recommendations" is ambiguous, because it can mean that the instructions appear after the recommendations or that the instructions comply with the recommendations. In ASDTE, the same sentence is unambiguous, meaning only that the instructions appear after the recommendations.</p>

<p>Some controlled languages permit compound nouns that are underspecified as to their senses. When a noun modifies another noun, the modification can be ambiguous. When more than 2 nouns are compounded, the modificational scope can be ambiguous. For example, ASD Simplified Technical English permits compounds of up to 3 nouns. The compound noun "telephone drawer" exhibits modificational ambiguity: It may mean a drawer that is used for storing a telephone, or it may mean a drawer (such as for frequently called numbers) contained within a telephone. (Likewise, a "drawer telephone" may be a telephone in a drawer, or a telephone containing a drawer.) The compound noun "cotton clothing patches" exhibits scope ambiguity: It may mean patches (of any kind) for cotton clothing, or it may mean cotton patches for (any kind of) clothing.</p>

<p>Informal restraints on lexical ambiguity do not provide guaranteed prevention of ambiguity. For example, ASD Simplified Technical English licenses the sentence "Stop the engine with the emergency switch". In natural English, this sentence is ambiguous, because it can mean either "Using the emergency switch, stop the engine" or "Of the engines, stop the one that has the emergency switch". This ambiguity arises from the combination of the polysemy of "with" and the attachment ambiguity of the prepositional phrase. Likewise, "Always clean the tanks with sulfuric acid" can mean "Always use sulfuric acid to clean the tanks" or "Of the tanks, always clean those that contain sulfuric acid". Similar ambiguities apply to approved ASDSTE examples, such as  "IDENTIFY THE WIRES WITH SLEEVES OF DIFFERENT COLORS" and "PUT OIL INTO THE GEARBOX WITH A SYRINGE". ASDTE tolerates the ambiguity of such sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no rule uniquely interpreting the attachment of each prepositional phrase.</li>
<li>The word "with" is defined in the lexicon as having 3 different meanings: (1) "association or relationship", (2) "help or sharing", and (3) "means or instrument".</li>
<li>The examples and advice provided for the use of "with" by the ASDSTE specification do not show any intent to prohibit the "having" sense of "with".</li>
<li>Some approved examples license the "having" sense of "with", e.g. "THIS PROCEDURE IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO AIRCRAFT WITH ECM PODS" and "MEASURE THE DIMENSIONS WITH A 
METAL RULE WITH GRADUATIONS IN MILLIMETERS".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test Sentences for Ambiguity Control</h3>

<p>"Every x does not y" can mean "Not every x ys" or "No x ys".</p>

<p>"A v ws an x ying a z" can mean "A v, ying a z, ws an x" or "A v ws an x that ys a z".</p>

<p>"As a baboon who grew up wild in the jungle, I realized that Wiki had special nutritional needs."</p>
