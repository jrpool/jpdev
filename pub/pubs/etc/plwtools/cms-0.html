<h2>Content Management</h2>
<h3>Plone</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>An open-source software product.</p>
<blockquote>... a content management system with strong multilingual support.</blockquote>
<blockquote>an intranet and extranet server, ... a document publishing system, a portal server and ... a groupware tool for collaboration between separately located entities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Plone interface has more than 50 language translations, and tools for managing multilingual content.</blockquote>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>The project has a content-rich <a href="http://plone.org/">Web site</a>.
<p>The multilingual-support features are documented in section 6.1.1.2 (pp. 133-138) of <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/definitive-guide/definitive_guide_to_plone.pdf"><i>The Definitive Guide to Plone</i></a>.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>There is apparently automated support for translation management but not for translation execution.</p>
<p>The guide says "Translating the content that people add is actually quite a tricky task and something that Plone is working toward, but currently it hasn't completely ironed out. The favorite approach at the moment is to use two products, PloneLanguageTool and i18nLayer, both of which can be found on SourceForge (http://sf.net/projects/collective). However, both of these are for more experienced developers to fully understand and integrate ...."</p>
