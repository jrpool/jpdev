<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Tools for a Panlingual Web</h3>
<h4>Criteria</h4>
<p>The tools surveyed here are designed so as to permit Web resources that are language-specific to become language-independent, such that a person's access to the resources may depend on the kind and extent of the person's language competence but does not depend on the particular language(s) in which the person has such competence.</p>
<p>Tools included in this survey are designed to make language independence substantially more efficiently achievable than would be the case if a unilingual resource were made panlingual by purely human translation into all human languages of all linguistic content of the resource.</p>
<p>In this review, "translation management" is distinguished from "translation execution": The former is the organization and recordkeeping associated with translation; the latter is the work translators do in choosing a representation in a target language for an expression in a source language.</p>
