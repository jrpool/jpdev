<h3>0. Preface</h3>

<p>This essay is a preliminary version of a potential article or lecture. My intent is to solicit advice on whether there is a likely audience for an article or lecture on this subject and, if so, what kinds of persons the audience would consist of and what format and venue might serve the audience's needs.</p>

<p>Some sources for the information here are listed at the end.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Governments make decisions about languages. Governments use languages as media of communication internally, with constituents, with other governments, and with other entities. Governments encode their constitutions, statutes, judicial decisions, and other official texts in languages. Governments operate schools that teach individuals to become capable of using languages. Governments subsidize the cultivation, enrichment, standardization, and study of languages. Governments reward individuals for choosing to use some languages and disincentivize, or criminalize, the use of other languages. Governments relocate, exile, deport, ghettoize, imprison, torture, and kill persons for using, or being native speakers of, languages. Governments confer honors and preferred statuses on some languages while attaching stigmas to other languages.</p>

<p>Among the common decisions about language made by governments are decisions to declare particular languages official. Some governments declare single languages official, while other governments declare multiple languages official. Some of the latter governments confer the same status on each official language, while others distinguish their official languages by degrees or with different officializing terms, such as "official", "national", "state", and "common". The behavioral implications of official-language declarations vary.</p>

<h3>2. State and Territory Precedents</h3>

<p>Governments of states and territories of the United States have been among those declaring languages to be official. It is possible to summarize their actions according to when, how, and what they have decided.</p>

<h4>When</h4>

<p>Official-language decisions of states and territories of the United States have taken place since 1902, and they have continued until 2007. The known decisions by year are:</p>

<ul>

<li>1902: Puerto Rico.</li>

<li>1923: Nebraska, Illinois.</li>

<li>1952: Guam.</li>

<li>1969: Illinois.</li>

<li>1974: Guam.</li>

<li>1978: Hawaii.</li>

<li>1981: Virginia.</li>

<li>1984: Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee.</li>

<li>1986: California.</li>

<li>1987: Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina.</li>

<li>1988: Colorado, Florida.</li>

<li>1989: New Mexico, Oregon, Washington.</li>

<li>1990: Alabama.</li>

<li>1991: Puerto Rico.</li>

<li>1992: Rhode Island.</li>

<li>1993: Puerto Rico.</li>

<li>1995: Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota.</li>

<li>1996: Georgia, Wyoming.</li>

<li>1998: Alaska, Missouri.</li>

<li>2000: Utah.</li>

<li>2002: Iowa.</li>

<li>2006: Arizona.</li>

<li>2007: Idaho.</li>

</ul>

<p>This list supports the proposition that decisions on official languages have been relatively recent in the history of the United States. One might imagine that, in principle, choosing one or more official languages would be a fundamental and inescapable decision for any newly established government, in which case the dates of decisions would mainly coincide with the dates of formation of territories and states. Instead, in the case of the decisions of subunits of the United States listed here, the last 10% of the history of the United States has witnessed about 84% of the decisions.</p>

<h4>How</h4>

<p>States and territories have made decisions about official languages primarily in two ways: by constitutional provisions and by statutory provisions. About one-fourth (9 out of 37) of the listed decisions were constitutional, and the remainder were statutory.</p>

<p>One might wonder whether states and territories are free to adopt official-language decisions either constitutionally or statutorily, as they may please. In view of the paucity of decisions during the first 90% of the history of the United States, subunits generally did not have any constitutional provisions expressly declaring official languages when the bulk of them decided to make decisions on this subject, so they did not have conflicting constitutional provisions that their decisions would require them to amend. Insofar as any constraints on their freedom to make such decisions might be federally imposed, these would presumably apply regardless of whether the decisions were framed constitutionally or statutorily. Hence, while a decision on the official language of a political unit can be argued to be a typically constitutional decision, states and territories have been free to make such decisions statutorily, and most have chosen to do so. This has presumably made the decisions easier to make, but also easier to repeal.</p>

<h4>What</h4>

<p>The decisions on official languages made by states and territories in the United States have mostly been to declare a single language official, and it has been English. The exceptions are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Puerto Rico (1902 and 1993): Spanish and English.</li>

<li>Hawaii (1978): English and Hawaiian.</li>

<li>Guam (1974): English and Chamorro.</li>

<li>Illinois (1923): American.</li>

<li>New Mexico (1989): None.</li>

<li>Oregon (1989): None.</li>

<li>Rhode Island (1992): None.</li>

<li>Washington (1989): None.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thus, the number of languages declared official has ranged from 0 to 2 in United States subunits.</p>

<p>The term most commonly used by states and territories to designate official languages is "official language". Occasionally, other terms, including "state language", "official state language", "language of government", and "common language", are used.</p>

<p>What does it mean for a state to declare that it has no official language? It may be interpreted as equivalent to the status quo ante, or to the failure of a government to declare any language official. However, in distinction from official silence, such a decision can also be understood to announce that the question has been raised and disposed of, in favor of refraining from declaring any language official.</p>

<p>Not declaring any language official does not, however, imply not acting on languages. Governments of states and territories act on languages with or without declarations of official languages. Common examples are decisions to communicate internally and externally in, and to teach children to be competent in, particular languages. States and territories have also acted to protect and to impair the privileges of speakers of particular languages, without declaring any languages official. For example, New Mexico's 1911 constitution provided that the right "to vote, hold office, or sit upon juries, shall never be restricted, abridged, or impaired on account of ... language ..., or inability to speak, read or write the English or Spanish languages ...." States and territories have also taken coercive actions against languages without ever declaring them unofficial or declaring any other language official. Examples of such anti-language coercion include prohibiting the use of particular languages in public and private school instruction, prohibiting their use in business signage, and forbidding state employees to speak them on the job. State and territorial governments have, arguably, participated in the most coercive actions taken against speakers of particular languages, such as mass killing, expulsion, expropriation, and forcible disintegration of families, which--whatever their intended effects--have contributed to the partial and complete extermination of dozens of languages. Without expressly dealing with language, governments throughout the United States in almost all cases have utilized English as the sole language of the conduct of domestic business. They have almost always conducted legislative, executive, and judicial communications only in English and published constitutions, statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions only in English, typically without the question of which language to use having been raised by anybody.</p>

<p>Conversely, what does it mean for a state or territory to declare a language, or two languages, official? As stated above, the implications vary.</p>

<p>In some cases, it is not clear from the record that the decision implies any behavioral consequences. For example, the 1987 North Dakota statute, in its entirety, is "The English language is the official language of the state of North Dakota." It defines no rights, no obligations, no remedies, and no enforcement procedures.</p>

<p>In other cases, the rights and obligations are vague, but the legislature and/or the people are empowered to enforce them. For example, the 1988 Florida action adopted a constitutional amendment providing that "English is the official language of the state of Florida" and "The legislature shall have the power to enforce this section by appropriate legislation". Some states have vaguely prescribed that their legislatures "shall make no law which diminishes or ignores the role of English as the common language" of those states.</p>

<p>Other decisions have prescribed categorical exceptions to the vague rights and obligations implied by an official language. Among these are provisions that permit the use of languages other than the official language for the purpose of providing equal educational opportunity, teaching foreign languages, protecting public safety, protecting the public health, assuring that justice is done in the legal system, communicating intelligibly with citizens, negotiating with neighboring territories of other countries, promoting tourism, and promoting cultural exchanges.</p>

<p>In still other cases, specific rights and obligations are prescribed. For example, some decisions prohibit the use of non-official languages for the printing of ballots in elections, the publication of government documents, the compilation of the official records of court cases, and the delivery of instruction in the public schools, and others confer equal opportunity to individuals in competition for government employment without disadvantage based on their lack of knowledge of non-official languages.</p>

<p>Thus, declarations have been made with and without regulations, and regulations have been enacted with and without declarations. Official language declarations by states and territories have often been accompanied by vague or specific acts regulating the statuses of languages, but apparently in no case has any state or territory sought to define expressly the concept of "official language", and a fortiori none has sought to use a definition of it as a basis for implied regulations.</p>

<h3>3. World Precedents</h3>

<p>Governments throughout the world have exhibited a wide range of official-language declaration practices.</p>

<p>The U.S. English Foundation has attempted to compile English translations of the official-language instruments of all sovereign states and has found such instruments for 58 states. Its translations reveal several terms used by sovereign states to designate official statuses for their languages. Among these are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Algeria: Arabic is "the national and official language".</li>

<li>Azerbaijan: Azerbaijani is "the State language".</li>

<li>Finland: Finnish and Swedish are "the national languages".</li>

<li>France: French is "the language of the Republic".</li>

<li>Ireland: Irish is the "national language" and "the first official language", and English is "a second official language".</li>

<li>Norway: Norwegian is "the language of the Country".</li>

<li>Sri Lanka: Sinhala is "the official language".</li>

<li>Sri Lanka: Tamil is "an official language".</li>

<li>Sri Lanka: English is "the link language".</li>

</ul>

<p>Some of the 58 countries' official-language provisions are far from declaring any language official. For example, Luxembourg's provision is simply: "The law shall regulate the use of languages in administrative and judicial matters."</p>

<p>The Ethnologue database classifies the governments of sovereign states with respect to their "national or official language(s)". Ethnologue converts various legal terms and practices into this single classification. On this basis, 140 states have a single national or official language each, and 98 have more than one.</p>

<p>A semi-anonymously authored article in the English edition of Wikipedia titled "Official Languages" lists languages that have what it calls "official language status", "regional language status", and "minority language status", by country. There are 195 countries in its list.</p>

<p>In addition to countries and their subunits, intergovernmental organizations assign official statuses to languages. These range from a single official language, such as Arabic in the Arab League, to 23 (potentially 28 if candidate members join) in the European Union. Some intergovernmental organizations use the term "working language" to describe an official status distinct from that of other languages that they call "official".</p>

<p>Titles assigned to languages have a tendency to covary with the benefits bestowed by governments on languages and their speakers. Languages called "official" tend to be treated better than languages called "national" or "working", for example. But these are only tendencies, and there are exceptions. It is common to designate multiple languages as official but in reality to utilize one of them far more than the others. The European Union, with 23 official languages, utilizes English most intensively, then French, and so on, with most of its languages used rarely except in translations required by its treaties. In some cases one can surmise that governments call languages official, national, etc. not to reflect the de facto importance that they accord to these languages, but rather to compensate for the governmental neglect that these languages suffer.</p>

<p>Thus, in other countries and in intergovernmental organizations, as in the subunits of the United States, a declared official language does not necessarily have governmental protection or promotion, and languages that governments use and favor are not necessarily declared to be official.</p>

<h3>4. Washington Deliberations</h3>

<p>Discussions about language policy in Washington took place in the mid-nineteenth century when educators and regulators sometimes debated the role of native languages in schools. Some educators found that using native languages helped pupils understand what was being taught, while others concluded that prohibiting pupils from using native languages in their private conversations impelled them to learn English more thoroughly.</p>

<p>Calls for a statewide policy declaring an official language became noticeable in the 1980s, presumably because the movement to make English the sole official language of the federal and state governments gained strength. This movement aroused opposition, and the results varied among the states. Four states adopted resolutions declining to name any language official and, instead, affirming their governments' encouragement of linguistic diversity in governmental activity. Washington was one of those states.</p>

<p>In the 1991-1992, 1995-1996, 1997-1998, and 2007-2008 sessions, Washington legislators introduced resolutions in the house or senate (the latest being House Joint Resolution 4219 in 2007), to amend the constitution to declare English the official language of Washington. The proposed amendments imposed vague obligations on the legislature and other state officials, namely to "take all steps necessary to ensure that the English language and the role it has played as the common language of the state of Washington are preserved, protected, strengthened, and perpetuated" and to "make no law that diminishes or ignores the English language or the role it has played as the common language of the state of Washington". They also gave all residents and persons doing business in Washington standing to sue the state for the enforcement of the amendment. The 2007 resolution was discussed unfavorably by one member of the Washington State Commission on Hispanic Affairs in a newsletter (Vol. 1, Issue IX, 22 March 2007), but, otherwise, these proposed resolutions appear to have aroused almost no discussion inside or outside the legislature.</p>

<p>The few manifestations of debate in Washington about the issue of official languages seem to exhibit the same arguments found in debates elsewhere in the United States. There is typically a pro-English side advocating that English be declared the sole official language and that some governmental uses of languages other than the official language be prohibited. This position is typically opposed by a pro-diversity side advocating the retention of the status quo, in which no language is declared official. Pro-English statements tend to claim that prior immigrant cohorts learned English without complaint but contemporary immigrants are lazy and demand services in their original languages. This argument posits that satisfying such demands would impose intolerable costs on the public, would keep immigrants and their children in the underclass, and would turn the polity into a collection of linguistic fiefdoms, manipulated by bilingual power brokers. Pro-diversity statements tend to claim that declaring English official would express intolerance for those whom the United States should instead welcome, and that further restricting immigrants' ability to use their native languages to communicate with governments would deny governmental services, educational interventions, and participatory opportunities to them, thus perpetuating their deprivation instead of curing it. The pro-diversity side also sometimes alleges that immigrants continue to strive to learn English, but that supposedly pro-English politicians hypocritically vote against making funds available for English courses for immigrants.</p>

<h3>5. General Findings</h3>

<p>Declaring languages official is a symbolic act, with no necessary behavioral implications, unless the concept "official language" is already defined as entailing rights or obligations. Such prior definitions tend to exist in intergovernmental organizations, but not in the laws of sovereign states and their subunits.</p>

<p>Conversely, governments often choose languages for the conduct of their affairs without necessarily making express decisions to do so. This pattern is particularly common in the subunits of the United States, where English has almost always been the sole language of governmental business without having been overtly selected for this purpose. The overt designation of an official language in the United States was rare until the 1980s.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, the initiative for declarations of official languages in states and territories of the United States has come from persons seeking to protect the de facto unilingual status quo against an expansion of the repertoire of languages used by governments. Persons wanting to dismantle the status quo and establish rights for the official use of languages other than English have generally not advocated the declaration of such additional languages as official.</p>

<h3>6. Principles</h3>

<p>As a general rule, languages per se have no legal statuses in the United States. They have no rights, may not be protected as endangered species when their extinction becomes probable, and have no legal personhood.</p>

<p>However, it is possible for policymakers to recognize, protect, promote, and use languages. They exercise broad discretion in doing so, precisely because of the failure of the legal system to grant statuses to languages.</p>

<p>Thus, the question arises, on what principles should policies on official languages be based?</p>

<p>Facts developing and discovered since the early 20th century have created reasons, not previously understood, to consider languages as public goods and language minorities as having legitimate interests in the continual use of their languages. Living languages appear to be essential pieces of scientific evidence about the organization of the genetic language faculty in the human brain. With each language that dies, it becomes less possible to understand this faculty. This understanding is intrinsically important for progress in pure and applied human, and partcularly cognitive, sciences and engineering, such as for the design of systems of artificial intelligence, systems that can understand human language, and cures for neurological disabilities. Linguistic diversity, moreover, is a cause and effect of ethnic and biological diversity, which is now widely understood to benefit the world in many ways. Language minorities, then, can be understood as carriers of linguistic diversity and, as such, providers of public goods. It can serve the public interest to subsidize the maintenance of minority languages by their native speakers. The evidence is abundant that many members of language minorities seek personal language maintenance rather than assimilation into the surrounding language group. In particular, this tends to be true in groups that have been involuntarily expelled from their native countries and hope to return thereto. For such persons, living life away from home as they lived it at home is a reasonable aspiration. Their host country can consider itself to be providing temporary accommodations aimed at replicating the guests' prior environment, linguistically and otherwise. A policy aiming to accomplish this purpose would differ completely from one aiming at the most effective possible transition of an immigrant into a fully functional member of an English-dominant society. We know more now about the conditions under which assimilation to a dominant language has taken place, and they have been less voluntary than previously presumed. The shrinkage of many minority languages and the extinction of others have resulted not only from free choice, but also from contagious disease, alcoholism, arbitrary killing, land theft, treaty violation, breaking up minority families, punishing schoolchildren for speaking their languages, and treating those languages as barbarous dialects instead of intricate cognitive systems. Finally, investigations of and living experiments in language revival and revitalization have shown that death is not an inevitable fate of languages with few speakers; techniques of documentation, motivation, teaching, and linguistic computation can under some conditions make language revitalization popular and practical.</p>

<p>In addition to facts, moral norms have evolved, so that governmental efforts to eradicate native languages in the wake of massive immigrations and settlements are no longer considered tolerable. Norms appear to be changing toward the voluntary acceptance of moral and sometimes financial responsibility for prior acts by governments or their predecessors that became illicit after they were committed, including acts of slavery, internment, expulsion, and genocide, and the idea that moral liability expires after the passage of a particular time is becoming less accepted. The voluntary assumption of responsibility has led to acts of apology, reparation, and restoration.</p>

<h3>7. Recommendations</h3>

<p>The persistent and, in many states, successful attempts of defenders of English to declare English the sole official language has created an issue that, until now, has elicited only one kind of opposition: the defense of the status quo.</p>

<p>But the status quo is no longer reasonable, in light of new knowledge about the benefits of linguistic diversity, the value to cognitive sciences of evidence extractable from living minority languages, the wishes and needs of involuntary migrants, and the judgments that contemporary norms induce about past linguicidal acts of current governments and their predecessors.</p>

<p>The official-language issue could be captured and repurposed with the aim of addressing these inadequacies of the status quo. In Washington, the 1989 resolution could become the foundation for a statute or constitutional amendment that would declare official languages. The languages declared official could include, for example, all languages currently spoken at home by at least 30,000 Washingtonians and all native languages known to have flourished when Washington Territory was established. This would total 23 languages. Such a provision could read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chinook, Chehalis, Clallam, Columbia Wenatchi, English, German, Kalispel Pend d'Oreille, Korean, Lushootseed, Malak, Mandarin Chinese, Okanagan, Quileute, Quinault, Russian, Salish, Skagit, Snohomish, Spanish, Spokane, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Yakima are official languages of the State of Washington.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The adoption of such a provision by Washington could be justified with a mixture of anticipated benefits:</p>

<p>1. The declaration of official languages would not per se impose obligations or costs on the state.</p>

<p>2. The purely symbolic declaration of official languages has numerous precedents, and there is no consensus on the meaning of "official language", so Washington would not be considered to have cheapened or misused an existing norm.</p>

<p>3. The provision would be interpreted partly as a statement of contrition and apology for cruelties inflicted on native Washington residents by newcomers whose beliefs in the eradication of native languages and customs contemporary Washingtonians now consider repugnant. Such statements help assuage the guilt of those who make them, reassure and vindicate those who are descended from the victims, and make cooperation between the perceived opposite parties more feasible.</p>

<p>4. The provision would be interpreted partly as a statement of an intent to improve the governmental treatment of the officialized languages. While not a binding commitment to make such improvements, the provision would legitimize them when proposed and encourage their potential advocates to argue for them. It would thereby contribute to the worldwide effort to preserve and revitalize endangered languages and to maintain linguistic diversity.</p>

<p>5. The conversion of the declaration into effective programs would enjoy the collaboration of Washington centers of expertise. These include experts on the multilingual operation of institutions (such as in the Cross Cultural Health Care Program), on the revitalization of endangered native languages (such as the four-tribe Lushootseed Language Preservation Project), and on the application of information technology to multiple languages (such as Microsoft, Adobe, and other Washington members of the Unicode Consortium). There are also related experts at Washington colleges and universities.</p>

<p>6. The provision would encourage the development of multilingual competence among Washington's population, initially by encouraging the maintenance of such competence in families where it already exists. An increasing supply of speakers of minority languages would make practical the expansion of dual-language enrichment programs in the state's schools, which have been found to be among the most effective techniques for the creation of fluently bilingual youths but cannot expand enough to meet the current demand because of staff unavailability.</p>

<p>7. Washington would become more attractive in the competition for inmigration of persons who have scarce skills, since it would give them a wider range of choices among linguistic environments for themselves and members of their accompanying families.</p>

<p>8. An announced policy of high tolerance for diverse languages and an intent to redress prior wrongs would attract to Washington persons with humane values.</p>

<p>9. By addressing hitherto neglected issues, the provision would create a new official-language status quo and settle a chronic issue, making it possible to defend the new status quo more successfully than the current one.</p>

<p>10. A statute or constitutional amendment would convey a collective decision with more finality than the currently effective legislative resolution, decreasing the temptation for the chronic reintroduction of bills on the official-language issue.</p>

<p>11. By inspiring various scholarly, ethnic, and tolerance-oriented interest groups to promote material measures building on the declaration, the provision would strengthen and vocalize the constituencies opposed to a declaration of English as a sole official language, stimulate their collaboration, and make an English-only declaration less viable as a proposal in the future.</p>

<p>12. The provision would be unique in the United States and in the world. This would bring valuable attention to Washington as the most advanced government in the recognition of the virtues of linguistic diversity.</p>
