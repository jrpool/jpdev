        <h1>Digital to-do lists for Kamala, Donald, Chase, and Jill</h1>
      </header>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>There are four <q>notable declared candidates</q> (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2024#Notable_declared_candidates_and_exploratory_committees">according to Ballotpedia</a>) for president of the United States: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, Chase Oliver, and Jill Stein. They all have websites to present their platforms, recruit volunteers, solicit donations, and attack one another.</p>
      <p>Can those websites be made more effective? Yes. How? Among other things, they can be made much more <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">accessible</a>.</p>
      <h2>What&rsquo;s the deal?</h2>
      <p>An accessible website incorporates internationally adopted standards for design and coding. It thereby reaches a larger and more diverse audience. It lets visitors navigate with less confusion, find what they want faster, understand the content more completely, and finish the transactions that they begin.</p>
      <p>The standards are reasonably clear, and it is possible to check instantly whether a website follows many of them. Not only that, but violating those standards has gotten thousands of organizations into legal trouble for alleged disability discrimination. It&rsquo;s a no-brainer: Make the site accessible!</p>
      <p>So I naturally wanted to find out how the presidential candidates are doing with website accessibility. After all, if they can&rsquo;t get their folks to follow the rules when making a website, can they be trusted to run the entire executive branch, act as commander in chief, and nominate justices and judges?</p>
      <h2>Here&rsquo;s what I found</h2>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the bottom line: All four websites have work to do. They all violate simple, basic acessibility rules&mdash;rules that would have been easy to obey, with a big impact on usability for various audience subtypes.</p>
      <h3>To-do 1: Help users fill out forms</h3>
      <p>Candidate websites contain forms. If you want to get news bulletins, you fill out a form. If you are ready to donate money, you fill out a form. To volunteer time, fill out a form.</p>
      <p>Well, there are rules for forms. In particular, the website must make it clear what information is to be provided and must also let the visitor enter standard types of personal data automatically.</p>
      <h4>Harris</h4>
      <p>Here we see a Harris form asking for the visitor&rsquo;s email address.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Harris email and ZIP Code form</figcaption>
        <img src="harris-inputs.png" alt="text input fields for email address and ZIP Code">
      </figure>
      <p>It obeys two rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Label the inputs visibly.</li>
        <li>Keep the labels present while the visitor enters text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But it breaks two other rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use ordinary letter case, not all-capitals (for easier legibility)</li>
        <li>Code the inputs with the correct <code>autocomplete</code> attribute (so visitors who have trouble typing can use automated form-completion tools).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is the invisible code underlying the email input:</p>
      <pre>&lt;input class="signupform__form-input signupform__form-input--email form__form-input form__form-input--email input-group__input" type="email" id="email-sticky" name="email" title="Please enter your email" required="" placeholder="email@email.com" field_signature="1029417091" form_signature="8925083436725633828" alternative_form_signature="14528359747955108172" visibility_annotation="true"></pre>
      <p>That code needs to include <code>autocomplete="email"</code>, but it is missing.</p>
      <h4>Trump</h4>
      <p>This form on the Trump site breaks the letter-case rule by using capital letters throughout the form.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Trump volunteering form</figcaption>
        <img src="trump-all-cap.png" alt="form with all-capital letters">
      </figure>
      <p>It also breaks the durable-label rule by using only placeholders inside the text input fields. A placeholder disappears as soon as you start entering your answer in a field. Here is an example, where I have entered <q>J</q> and can no longer see what the field is for. A person with memory limitations or anybody who gets distracted is affected by this violation.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Trump disappearing placeholder</figcaption>
        <img src="trump-placeholder.png" alt="text input field with disappearing placeholder">
      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, it breaks the requirement to provide <code>autocomplete</code> attributes.</p>
      <h4>Oliver</h4>
      <p>This form on the Oliver site breaks the durable-label rule and the <code>autocomplete</code> rule.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Oliver disappearing placeholder</figcaption>
        <img src="oliver-form.png" alt="text input field with disappearing placeholder">
      </figure>
      <h4>Stein</h4>
      <p>At the risk of inducing a yawn, here is yet another form, this time from Jill Stein, with disappearing placeholders instead of labels and without <code>autocomplete</code> attributes.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Stein disappearing placeholder</figcaption>
        <img src="stein-form.png" alt="text input field with disappearing placeholder">

      <h3>To-do 2: Don&rsquo;t make me click</h3>
      <p>If you are a typical web user, you may assume that everybody who browses on a full-size computer uses both a keyboard and a mouse. Not true. Many people with impaired mobility or tremors cannot control a mouse precisely enough. Users who cannot see typically avoid mice, since they don&rsquo;t know where they would be clicking or dragging. And some super-users are more productive using only a keyboard.</p>
      <p>A fundamental accessibility rule is that no website may require the use of a pointing device such as a mouse. But the websites of the presidential candidates break that rule.</p>
      <h4>Harris</h4>
      <p>When you first visit the Harris home page, before it has had a chance to deposit cookies on your computer, the site displays a <q>modal dialog</q>, namely a popup window, asking for money, and then, a few seconds later, another modal dialog inviting you to subscribe to notifications. Here is the page after these dialogs have appeared.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Harris modal dialogs</figcaption>
        <img src="harris-modals.png" alt="modal dialogs with Later and CLOSE buttons">
      </figure>
      <p>If you have no mouse and you want to get rid of these dialogs, what can you do? The answer: donate. An accessible modal dialog can be dismissed in two ways without a mouse: (1) You can press the Escape key. (2) You can press the Tab key until the <q>Close</q> button gets surrounded by an outline, and then you can press the Space or the Enter key to operate that button. On the Harris site, however, you can never reach the <q>Later</q> or the <q>CLOSE</q> button by pressing the Tab key, and pressing the Escape key does nothing. You also cannot reach the notification options with the Tab key. But there is a way to dismiss these dialogs: Press the Tab key until one of the donation amounts is highlighted, and then press the Enter key. That will take you out of the site to an ActBlue page, where you can complete a donation if you wish. But you are no longer on the Harris site.</p>
      <h4>Trump</h4>
      <p>The Trump site, too, starts you off with a modal dialog asking for money. Here it is.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Trump modal dialog</figcaption>
        <img src="trump-modal.png" alt="modal dialog with X button">
      </figure>
      <p>It, like the Harris dialog, cannot be dismissed without a mouse. The <q>X</q> in the corner will close the dialog if clicked, but you cannot reach it with the Tab key. You cannot even reach the donation amounts, and the Escape key has no effect.</p>
      <h4>Oliver</h4>
      <p>The Oliver website is a guessing game for a visitor who does not use a mouse. Accessibility standards require the page to show clearly where the Tab key has taken you. That is critical information, because whatever link, button, or input you are now on is the one you will operate if you press the Enter key, the Space key (for a button or checkbox), or text keys (for an input). This special status is the <q>focus</q>. An easily visible outline is the normal indicator of focus. But most often when you press the Tab key on the Oliver home page you see no focus indicator, so you are lost without a mouse. In some cases there is a focus indicator, but it is not prominent. Here is an example.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Oliver focus indicator</figcaption>
        <img src="oliver-focus.png" alt="thin dashed focus indicator">
      </figure>
      <h4>Stein</h4>
      <p>Focus indication is generally good on the Stein website, but some improvement is possible. Here is a donation form on which one amount has been focused. It takes good vision and careful scrutiny to be sure that the focused amount is $75. If you press the Enter key you are taken to another donation page with the $75.00 amount filled in for you. But what if you intended to donate another amount? You cannot focus any of the other amounts with the Tab key. You can focus the input field and type a different amount, but the focus indicator is faint, so you may not understand where you are.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Stein focus indicators</figcaption>
        <img src="stein-focus-1.png" alt="faint focus indicator">
        <img src="stein-focus-2.png" alt="faint focus indicator">
      </figure>
      <h3>To-do 3: Ask for help from your visitors</h3>
      <p>There is a consensus among accessibility specialists that candid two-way communication with the consumers of a website is crucial for genuine accessibility. It has become a standard practice to include in every website an <q>accessibility statement</q>. The statement tells visitors what kinds and amounts of accessibility the site owner is trying to achieve and how close to success the owner believes the site has come. The statement also invites comments and complaints from visitors and provides more than one channel of communication for submission, typically email, a comment form, and telephone.</p>
      <p>The Harris website is the only one of the four to implement this practice. The home page has a footer containing a link named <q>Accessibility</q>. That link takes you to a page named <q>WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT</q>. There the Harris campaign tells you, <q>We&apos;re continually working to improve the accessibility and usability of our site, so that all users have an excellent experience.</q> The page identifies a standard the campaign is trying to conform to: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 level AA. And the page invites you to provide complaints or suggestions and gives an email address.</p>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Harris accessibility statement link</figcaption>
        <img src="harris-a11y.png" alt="footer links including accessibility">
      </figure>
      <p>The other three campaigns can improve website accessibility by similarly leveling with their visitors and treating them as potential helpers.</p>
      <h3>To-do 4 through 79</h3>
      <p>These three examples should make it clear that (1) all four candidate websites have accessibility faults to remedy and (2) making such improvements is not rocket science.</p>
      <p>On each of the four home pages, I also performed about a thousand automated accessibility tests, from eleven different tools. The tools come from universities (including Princeton, Lisbon, and Utah State), an industry organization (the World Wide Web Consortium), and companies (IBM, Deque, Siteimprove, Squiz Labs, Wally, CVS Health, and eSSENTIAL Accessibility). To run these tests I used open-source software described in my recent blog entry <a href="https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/how-to-run-a-thousand-accessibility-tests-63692ad120c3"><q>How to run a thousand accessibility tests</q></a>. Such mass-production testing can find problems that human testers miss, and it is also inexpensive. But it can also report mistaken or questionable faults. The tests claim to have discovered <a href="reports/240922T1609-o20-00.html">70 issues (problem types) on the Harris page</a>, <a href="reports/240922T1609-o20-01.html">59 issues on the Trump page</a>, <a href="reports/240922T1906-oti-00.html">79 issues on the Oliver page</a>, and <a href="reports/240922T1906-oti-01.html">70 issues on the Stein page</a>.</p>
      <p>The maintainers of these four sites can review the reported issues as the remaining items in their to-do lists, decide which ones are credible, and make those fixes.</p>
