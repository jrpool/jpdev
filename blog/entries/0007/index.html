        <h1>Lazy regulation: hospital price transparency</h1>
        <p class="author">Jonathan Robert Pool</p>
        <p class="summary">Don&rsquo;t try to compare hospital prices; it&rsquo;s hopeless</p>
      </header>
      <p>On 1 January 2021, a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/27/2019-24931/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2020-hospital-outpatient-pps-policy-changes-and-payment-rates-and#sectno-citation-%E2%80%89180.50">federal rule, 84 FR 65524</a>, went into effect requiring hospitals to post documents disclosing their standard and negotiated prices.</p>
      <p>In the explanatory part of the rule, the author, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, stated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><q>consumers want greater healthcare pricing transparency</q></li>
        <li><q>we believe that transparency in healthcare pricing is critical to enabling patients to become active consumers so that they can lead the drive towards value</q></li>
        <li><q>there is inconsistent (and many times nonexistent) availability of provider charge information</q></li>
        <li><q>We believe this information gap can, in part, be filled by the new requirements we are finalizing in this final rule</q></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rule requires hospitals to post their standard and negotiated prices.</p>
      <h2>Massive noncompliance</h2>
      <p>One fact to note about this rule is that it is almost universally violated. The July 2021 <a href="https://bit.ly/3hKIY8d">Semi-Annual Hospital Price Transparency Compliance Report</a> published by Patient Rights Advocate discloses an audit of 500 randomly selected hospitals and says:</p>
      <blockquote>We estimate that only 5.6% or 28 hospitals of the 500 randomly sampled, were in compliance with all of the rule requirements. We estimate that 94.4% or 472 of the 500 hospitals, were noncompliant &hellip;.</blockquote>
      <h2>Useless compliance</h2>
      <p>Just as significant, however, is that even compliance with the rule does not do any practical good for informed patient healthcare shopping.</p>
      <p>To see how impractical it is to use the disclosed data, let&rsquo;s look at the first two <q>compliant</q> hospitals listed in the Patient Rights Advocate report:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Androscoggin Valley Hospital, in Berlin, New Hampshire</li>
        <li>Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville, in Jacksonville, Florida</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The websites</h3>
      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>The rule requires hospitals to post their price data on a public website. They do that, but where? The rule says <q>The standard charge information must be displayed in a prominent manner</q>, but does not say where on a website the data must be or how a user must be able to find the data.</p>
      <p>On the Androscoggin website, you might expect them to be in the <q>Health Tools</q> menu or the <q>Services</q> menu, but they aren&rsquo;t. Instead, you must use the <q>About Us</q> menu or the <q>Patients &amp; Visitors</q> menu. There you must choose the <q>Financial Services</q> link. But a glance at the destination page would tell you it&rsquo;s the wrong page, because its headings are only about <q>financial assistance</q>, until you get to the bottom of the page, where you finally reach a <q>Cost Estimates</q> heading. However, a list of published prices is not a cost estimate, so you still seem to be in the wrong place. Only if you read the long paragraphs underneath it will you finally see the sentence, <q>Androscoggin Valley Hospital's "Standard Charges," effective November 30, 2020, can be viewed by <a href="https://www.avhnh.org/images/uploads/Chg_Master_FY20.xlsx">clicking here</a>.</q>. And what if you choose to search instead? If you search on the site for <q>prices</q>, you get <q>Your search did not return any results.</q></p>
      <p><figure class="floatright"><figcaption>Baptist page heading</figcaption><img width="403" height="132" src="baptist.png" alt="Gross Charges heading, preceded by breadcrumbs Home, Patient Info, Billing And Insurance Information, and Patient Cost Estimate Request Overview"></figure>Baptist&rsquo;s navigation menus, likewise, contain no links to price data. You might guess that the <q>Billing &amp; Insurance Information</q> link in the <q>Patients</q> menu would get you there, but it doesn&rsquo;t. Instead, and counterintuitively, you must choose the <q>Cost Estimate Request</q> link. As with Androscoggin, that link name does not tell you that you can find published prices there. And, similarly to Androscoggin, the destination page seems wrong, because it is all about a tool for getting an estimate for an anticipated service&mdash;until you reach the middle of the page, where there is a <q>Current Standard Charges</q> heading. Under that heading, you learn that Baptist publishes its prices, and you can click a <q>Learn More</q> button. That opens a new page headed <q>Gross Charges</q>, and on it is a link, <q><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/raw/upload/v1624996808/BaptistJax/price-transparency/590747311_Baptist_Medical_Center_All_Sites_Standard_Charges_02112021.csv">Standard Charges for 10/1/20-9/30/21</a></q>. Searching for <q>prices</q> is more productive on this site, because the <q>Gross Charges</q> page is the 7th hit.</p>
      <p>So, do these two <q>compliant</q> hospitals in fact post their data <q>in a prominent manner</q>? In fact, the postings are more obscure than prominent.</p>
      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <p>The rule says <q>The hospital must ensure that the standard charge information is easily accessible, without barriers</q>, but does not specifically require the website to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/">current accessibility standards</a>. This makes it unclear whether the website may violate these standards and thus discriminate against users with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The Androscoggin website violates accessibility standards in several ways. One of the most obvious is that you can&rsquo;t use its navigation menus with your keyboard. Pressing the Tab key, you get lost, because the site deliberately prevents the browser from putting an outline around your currently focused menu button. And, even if you could see it, you could not enter its menu with the up-arrow, down-arrow, Enter, or Space key, which the standards prescribe as methods for opening end entering a menu.</p>
      <p>The Baptist site comes closer to accessibility compliance, but it still contains violations. For example, its <q>Get Started</q> link is defective, because it is too vague to let you know what it gets you started with, unless you can see the nearby text and infer that the link will get you started finding a doctor. If you were blind, you could not see the nearby text, and you might reach the link without ever hearing the nearby text from your screen reader.</p>
      <h3>The data</h3>
      <p>The rule requires hospitals to describe the services that they publish prices of. But it says little about <string>how</string> those services must be described. Therefore, no surprise:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hospitals differ in how they format their data.</li>
        <li>Not every hospital describes the same service the same way.</li>
        <li>Not every description is intelligible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A few examples will make these problems obvious.</p>
      <p>Baptist lists the following service: <q>Antibody identification, RBC antibodies, each panel for each serum technique</q>. Androscoggin does not list any service with that description, but does list this service: <q>AB ID RBC EA PANEL EA TECHN</q>. They are, I am guessing, the same service. But I am <strong>guessing</strong>. The rule permits hospitals to make me guess. In addition, Androscoggin is abbreviating terms, without disclosing the meanings of the abbreviations. Accessibility standards require us to define our abbreviations, not leave their meanings secret.</p>
      <p>The header of the Androscoggin description column is <q>Name</q>. The header of the Baptist description column is <q>/Facility/Charge/Item/Descr</q>. They are obviously different, and neither of them clearly tells you what is in its column.</p>
      <p>The Androscoggin file contains only two columns, <q>Name</q> and <q>Amount</q>. The Baptist file contains 20 columns, all with confusing headers, such as <q>/Facility/Charge/Item/DiscountCashCharge/#agg</q>.</p>
      <p><figure class="floatright"><figcaption>Multiple Androscoggin prices</figcaption><img width="508" height="124" src="andro.png" alt="multiple prices for the same service"></figure>When the same service is listed more than once, the sites differ in how they distinguish the listings. Baptist distinguishes them in another column, headed <q>/Facility/Charge/Item/Contracts/Contract/@Payer</q>, where it names various payers (such as <q>CAPITAL HEALTH PLAN</q>). But Androscoggin does not distinguish them at all. For example, it lists the service <q>ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JNT REPAIR</q> three times, with prices ranging from $880 to $9,286, but says nothing to let you know which price might be relevant for you.</p>
      <p>The Androscoggin file is in the <code>xlsx</code> (Excel) format. The Baptist file is in the <code>csv</code> (comma-separated values) format.</p>
      <p>Both files of data require you to download them and open them locally. You cannot inspect them on the hospital websites. You cannot look up any price on either website.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>If the judgments of Patient Rights Advocate are to be trusted, hospitals can comply with the current federal price-posting rules by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>posting files of price data in places that are difficult to find</li>
        <li>forcing users to find the data by navigating inaccessible websites</li>
        <li>naming services unintelligibly</li>
        <li>labeling columns of data incomprehensibly</li>
        <li>disclosing multiple prices with no explanation</li>
        <li>using diverse file formats</li>
        <li>forcing users to download and locally open files of data, instead of looking up prices on hospital websites</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these facts are bugs. They are deficiencies in the design of a user experience. They block users from convenient, intuitive access to information.</p>
      <p>The Patient Rights Advocate report recommends that the rule be strengthened to require <q>clear pricing data standards</q>. If the rule were to guarantee a decent end-user experience, the stronger standards would need to prescribe:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A single, simple algorithm for locating the data from any hospital, such as a CMS web service where each hospital posts the URL of its data.</li>
        <li>A standard method for navigating to or searching for the data on a hospital website.</li>
        <li>Compliance by hospital websites with current digital accessibility standards throughout the flow of a user from the home page to the data.</li>
        <li>Plain-language descriptions of services.</li>
        <li>Standard descriptions of services, so the same service is always named alike.</li>
        <li>Standard columns in a standard order.</li>
        <li>Standard column headers.</li>
        <li>A standard open-source file format.</li>
        <li>Either (1) a set of standard controls allowing user interrogatability of the price data on hospital websites, without the need to download and open files, or (2) the creation of a central accessible price-comparison website where the data from all hospitals would be gathered and made interrogatable by end users.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Given the formidable obstacles facing anybody who wants to make use of hospital-posted price data, it is astonishing and impressive that Patient Rights Advocate was willing and able to audit the data posted (or not posted) by 500 hospitals. But regulation designed to achieve the purpose of easy and intuitive discovery of information could make the job almost effortless. It could make discovery, validation, aggregation, and analysis of the data not only possible, but also cheap, for both humans and machines. That kind of regulation is not armchair vagueness, such as <q>in a prominent manner</q>. It is detailed technical specification, tested and revised for practical efficacy.</p>
