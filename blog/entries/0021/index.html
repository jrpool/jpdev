      <h2>Lawyers publish a warning</h2>
      <p>In June 2023 two attorneys posted a <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2023/06/new-california-assembly-bill-on-website-accessibility-could-result-in-a-lawsuit-tsunami/">blog entry</a>, <q>New California Assembly Bill on Website Accessibility Could Result in a Lawsuit Tsunami</q>.</p>
      <p>The bill they warned about was <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1757">AB 1757</a>, <q>Accessibility: internet websites</q>.</p>
      <p>In the authors&rsquo; analysis, the bill, if it became law, <q>would significantly expand the legal liability of business establishments, as well as their third party web developers, for websites and mobile apps that do not conform to WCAG 2.1 AA</q> and <q>could well open the floodgates of website and mobile app accessibility lawsuits in California</q>. They describe this as a <q>new standard</q> that it can be <q>expensive</q> and <q>take many months</q> to bring a website into conformance with, creating a <q>hardship</q> for small businesses, which may not have the resources for compliance.</p>
      <p>The abbreviation <dfn>WCAG 2.1</dfn> refers to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1</a>, developed and published by the World Wide Web Consortium (<dfn>W3C</dfn>). It defines standards of inclusivity at three levels: <q>A</q>, <q>AA</q>, and (the highest) <q>AAA</q>. Websites conforming to those standards tend to be easier to use, especially by the elderly, the blind, and people with other disabilities.</p>
      <h2>Lawyers recruit clients</h2>
      <p>The authors of the warning are part of the <a href="https://www.seyfarth.com/services/practices/advisory/ada-title-iii-and-public-access.html">disability law practice of a major law firm</a>. They advertise their unmatched expertise in defending businesses against claims of disability discrimination, such as claims that would be made under AB 1757 if it became law.</p>
      <p>Thus, their relationship to this bill is complex. They are campaigning against it, because it would (they assert) harm businesses like their clients. But, if the bill became law and it had the effects they predict, this firm would be indundated by fees from clients needing their services.</p>
      <p>The attorneys seem to be campaigning against their own interest. Why? Are they sincere, or do they really salivate at the cash that would flow in from the adoption of AB 1757? Or do they secretly fear that AB 1757 would actually, by more clearly defining a defense against inaccessibility claims, <em>decrease</em> the volume of accessibility litigation?
      </p>
      <h2>The big picture</h2>
      <p>Notwithstanding the alarmism, adopting AB 1757 would only slightly modify the accessibility ecosystem. That ecosystem, not AB 1757, is the phenomenon that deserves attention.</p>
      <h3>Web accessibility is a real problem</h3>
      <p>Hopes and concerns about the inclusivity of digital technology are as old as the technology itself. Digital innovations have created an entire industry of assistive devices that help to overcome disabilities. Everyday digital communications, however, are usually produced with unintended barriers that make them friendly for only a subset of younger, non-disabled, and tech-savvy recipients, if even them. <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">Almost all websites today have significant accessibility defects.</a> Digital accessibility&mdash;or the absence thereof&mdash;is increasingly affecting the quality of life as the world population ages, interactions become increasingly digital, and about 20% of humans have one or more disabilities.</p>
      <h3>Solution alternatives</h3>
      <p>Assuming as an axiom that digital accessibility is a virtue that you and I want to become universal rather than (as it is now) rare, four solutions are obvious:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Laissez faire: Accessible websites tend to be easier to use for everybody, especially people with disabilities, so a self-interested business can be expected to choose accessibility over inaccessibility, without any external influence. Those that fail at accessibility&mdash;or don&rsquo;t even try&mdash;will lose customers to those that succeed. Competition will wipe inaccessibility out.</li>
        <li>Community organizing: Promoters of digital accessibility who don&rsquo;t have the patience for&mdash;or don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;the laissez-faire solution can exercise influence by making accessibilty more known, more understood, more loved, and easier to do. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/">SIGACCESS</a>, the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/">International Association of Accessibility Professionals</a>, and other groups create information, hold conferences, grant certifications of expertise, educate, and promote solidarity in support of accessbility. Experts <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-HAG-19980123.html">started to codify digital accessibility in 1998</a> and have been doing so since then, to make accessibility easier to achieve. Version 2.1 of WCAG became an official W3C recommendation in June 2018, So the standard that the blog authors describe as <q>new</q> is 5 years old.</li>
        <li>State support: Governments promote what they favor by teaching it in public schools, subsidizing it with tax rewards and grants, creating facilitative institutions, incorporating it into their business rules, and publicizing it at state expense. Governments can support digital accessibility in all these ways. For example, the United States government requires software it procures from private companies to be accessible.</li>
        <li>Legal force: Governments also define crimes and civil obligations, enforceable administratively or judicially. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/">Governments around the world have, indeed, done this for digital accessibility.</a> Often they have incorporated a version of WCAG into law, thus mandating conformity to WCAG. The United States has done this to a limited extent, but most U.S. accessibility law is more vague. AB 1757 would not require conformity to WCAG 2.1, at level AA, but would use that standard as a defense: A website conforming to it would be presumed accessible until shown otherwise.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>A hybrid ecosystem</h3>
      <p>The existing accessibility ecosystem is a hybrid. It combines elements of all four of these models. The fourth model, legal force, is the one that keeps the blogging lawyers in business. It makes digital accessibility a problem of legal compliance and litigation risk management.</p>
      <p>The lawyers argued against one bill, but they said nothing to oppose the legal-force model of digital accessibility. Implicitly, the lawyers accept it.</p>
      <h3>Legal force: the broken model</h3>
      <p>There are reasons to question whether the inclusion of the legal-force model in the accessibility ecosystem does more good than harm to the cause of digital accessibility. Here are some reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Legal enforcement is inefficient.</em> While the cost of many transactions (such as buying shares of stock in a corporation) is a fraction of 1% of the transaction value, the cost of obtaining a decision on whether a website complies with accessibility law is often thousands of times as great as the alleged damage. This inefficiency is partly a property of the legal system and affects litigation on any topic, not only accessibility. But it is also partly a result of how the law defines (or, more accurately, fails to define) digital accessibility.</li>
        <li><em>Legal enforcement is slow.</em> Many transactions in our increasingly digital world are nearly instantaneous. A judicial case on digital accessibility, if it goes to trial and is resolved on appeal, typically takes five years or more. Meanwhile, thousands of additional cases are initiated without the benefit of the precedent that the case might someday set.</li>
        <li><em>Legal enforcement is too late.</em> It is a truism in software development that repairing a defect costs many times as much as avoiding that defect. Legal enforcement takes place too late for the defects to be avoided. Moreover, the cost of repairs mandated by a legal judgment is even greater.</li>
        <li><em>Legal enforcement is coercive.</em> Coercive solutions face resistance from those subjected to actual or feared penalties, and also from courts. Here the wrongdoing that is penalized is speech, which makes a coercive solution even more difficult to engineer. The speech is often, though not always, commercial, but even then there are bases for a defense that would not exist in a case on physical accessibility, such as a wheelchair ramp.</li>
        <li><em>Legal enforcement is unnecessary.</em> The opportunities for state support (model 3) are massive, but largely unexploited. Sufficient government support for digital accessibility could make the adoption of accessible options no-brainers and the path of least resistance when websites are designed and built. Currently, computer science and engineering curricula usually omit digital accessibility; government grants to schools and universities could make the curricular inclusion of accessibility a prerequisite. Most businesses (or their web contractors) use website construction tools to build websites, but none of the tools makes accessibility easy and automatic; governments could create tools with more iron-clad accessibility guarantees and make those tools available for public use in website construction. Governments could also offer web accessibility inspections, analogous to building inspections, with certificates of accessibility issued upon success. If the U.S. Department of Agriculture can certify an apple as organic, then the U.S. Access Board can certify a website as accessible.</li>
        <li><em>The legal-force model nourishes a class of accessibility noncompliance profiteers.</em> Digital accessibility enforcement provides much of the revenue earned by these businesses:
          <ul>
            <li>Law firms that file thousands of accessibility complaints every year</li>
            <li>Law firms that defend clients against accessibility complaints</li>
            <li>Website developers that charge for inaccessible websites and then charge again for correcting their own errors</li>
            <li>Accessibility consultants that verify compliance</li>
            <li>Firms that add alleged instant inaccessibility cures to websites</li>
          </ul>
          Most of the <a href="https://jpdev.pro/jpdev/blog/entries/0009/index.html">accessibility law firms</a> and <a href="https://jpdev.pro/jpdev/blog/entries/0008/index.html">accessibility consultants and instant-cure companies</a> have not taken the trouble to make their own websites accessible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The hybrid accessibility ecosystem has not yet produced a universe of accessible websites and does not seem likely ever to do so. The ecosystem relies only sparingly on a state-support model, and heavily on a legal-force model that is broken and impossible to repair. The legal-force model has created a class of accessibility noncompliance profiteers, who are not denouncing the model that feeds them.</p>
      <p>There are, however, major interests that would benefit from an ecosystem that shifts emphasis from legal force to state support. They are the elderly, people with disabilities, and those who own websites. They are far more numerous than the current ecosystem&rsquo;s profiteers. If they organized to advance their shared interest, change might happen.</p>
