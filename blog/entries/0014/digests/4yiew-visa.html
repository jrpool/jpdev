      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro">Testaro</a> application used its <code>tp15</code> testing procedure to test the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"><dfn>accessibility</dfn></a> (barrier-free design and coding) of the Visa (100%) web page at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/">https://usa.visa.com/</a> on 2022/08/13. The procedure performed 1230 tests. Of these, 24 are custom tests defined by Testaro, and the others belong to these seven other packages (programs that perform collections of tests):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa">Alfa</a> by Siteimprove</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core">Axe-core</a> by Deque</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.webaccessibility.com/tools/">Continuum</a> by Level Access</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html_codesniffer">HTML CodeSniffer</a> by Squiz Labs
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access">Equal Access</a> by IBM</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/validator/validator">Nu Html Checker</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tenon.io/documentation/apiv2.php">Tenon</a> by Level Access</li>
        <li><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/api/">WAVE</a> by WebAIM</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Testaro produced a report enumerating the test results.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo">Testilo</a> processed the report and used the <code>sp15c</code> scoring procedure to compute partial and total scores for the page. The total score is 2337 (where 0 is the best possible score). The scored report is appended below.</p>
      <p>Finally, Testilo used procedure <code>dp15a</code> to produce this digest, briefly explaining how <code>sp15c</code> computed the scores.</p>

      <h2>Issue summary</h2>
      <h3>Special issues</h3>
      <p><span class="componentID">log</span>: Score 124. This is based on the amount of browser error logging and miscellaneous logging during the tests.
      <p><span class="componentID">preventions</span>: Score 100. This is based on tests that the page did not allow to be run. That impedes accessibility progress and risks interfering with tools that users with disabilities need.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>Although there are widely accepted <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/">accessibility standards</a>, there is no unanimity about how to define, test, and quantify accessibility. The failures reported in this digest merit investigation as potential opportunities for improved accessibility. Investigation may lead you to conclude that some of the reported failures do not actually harm accessibility. Conversely, some substantial accessibility faults can escape detection by any of these tests. You may question the attempt to assign an accessibility score to a web page, or you may prefer weightings and formulas different from those used by <code>sp15c</code>. You can modify and extend Testaro and Testilo to fit other theories and priorities.</p>
      <p>Here, in brief, is how <code>sp15c</code> computes a score for a page.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It finds all the defects and warnings (let&rsquo;s call them <q>issues</q>) recorded in the report.</li>
        <li>It classifies them according to type. For example, a link that looks like the text around it is one issue category, while a video that has no captions is another issue category.</li>
        <li>It also classifies the issues according to severity. For example, an issue that prevents a transaction is more severe than an issue that only complicates the transaction, and a warning about a possible issue is less severe than a definite finding of an issue. (Some packages rate the severity of each issue; for the other packages, <code>sp15c</code> assigns a severity weight to the issue type and uses that weight.)</li>
        <li>It assigns quality ratings to particular tests that are judged abnormally reliable or unreliable.</li>
        <li>It assigns a score to each issue reported by each test of each package.</li>
        <li>It aggregates the issue scores, weighting them by severity, test quality, and redundancy. Redundancy occurs, and causes downweighting, when two or more packages contain tests that are designed to discover the same or mostly the same issues. So the score for a category is not simply the sum of the scores of the tests in that category.</li>
        <li>It assigns a score for issues in the page logged by the browser.</li>
        <li>It assigns an estimated score each time the page prevents one of the packages or one of the Testaro tests from being run on the page.</li>
        <li>It adds the scores together to obtain a total score.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The precise rules of <code>sp15b</code> are found in the <a href="https://github.com/jrpool/testilo/blob/main/procs/score/sp15c.js">code itself</a>.</p>
