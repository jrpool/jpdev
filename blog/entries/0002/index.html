<h1>Developing accessibility</h1>
<p class="author">Jonathan Pool</p>
<p class="summary">Web developers can use the rules of accessibility to make content more universally functional.</p>
</header>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I began to learn about <dfn>web accessibility</dfn> in 2018 while refreshing my front-end development skills at <a href="https://www.learnersguild.org">Learners Guild</a> in Oakland, California. It&rsquo;s the problem of making websites, and all resources delivered by means of the World Wide Web, functional&mdash;or at least <em>more</em> functional&mdash;to everybody, and in particular to people whose access would otherwise be abnormally limited, such as by long-term, temporary, or age-related disabilities.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, you are designing a website that gives instructions for assembling an item of furniture, and you want people who know various languages to understand it, so you pursue this accessibility by using <a href="http://www.ikea.com/assembly_instructions/billy-bookcase--202-cm__JXQ13_PUB.PDF">line drawings with stick figures</a>, arrows, clock icons showing times of day, and a silent video to do most or all of the explanation. Great (if it works); you now have an alingual, and thus panlingual, website. But what about a blind person who wants to assemble that furniture item? All your accessibility efforts will fall flat for that user. If you had written the instructions with text in some language, then the blind user could use a screen reader to convert the instructions from text to speech, and an automated translation service could try to convert it from its original language to the user&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>So, accessibility is a tough problem. Making resources overcome some barriers may exacerbate other barriers.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Users with disabilities can adopt three main strategies in dealing with web content. They can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use one ability instead of another. For example, if a video contains subtitles, somebody who cannot hear can read the subtitles.</li>
    <li>Use <dfn>assistive technologies</dfn> to interpret the content and convert it from one medium to another. For example, if there are no subtitles, a speech-to-text converter can render video dialogues readable.</li>
    <li>Do their best.</li>
</ul>
<p>Text is the universal pivot for conversion. It is easier to convert text to anything else than to convert video, graphics, or voice. So, accessibility generally requires that non-text content be accompanied by text.</p>
<p>For users who do their best with the content that is there, accessible content requires only moderate user skill. For example, a website is not accessible if it displays medium gray text on a dark gray background, because that requires excellent vision. If a page contains a form with buttons to make choices, the buttons must be farther apart than a specified distance, so those with limited pointing control can more easily choose one. And it must be possible to navigate among and press those buttons by using only a keyboard; a mouse must be optional. Speedy fingers must not be demanded; if you press the mouse button and don&rsquo;t immediately release it, you won&rsquo;t suffer damage.</p>
<p>Site architecture is also subject to accessibility standards. Moving from item to item with a tab key must follow an appropriate path; sites where the tab key moves the focus quasi-randomly around a page are not accessible. Page structure must be interpretable by a program. Is it divided into sections and subsections? Is part of it required and part optional? If so, then this structure must be one that a program can discern; it must not be evident only to humans who can see it.</p>
<p>Common operations that users perform on web content (such as <q>undo</q> and <q>log in</q>) must be labeled in a consistent and conventional fashion, so assistive devices can reliably understand the controls that perform them and operate those controls when instructed by users to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, websites must not make anything flash more than 3 times per second, since that could trigger seizures.</p>
<p>This is only a sample of what makes web content accessible, but it gives the flavor.</p>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<p>Web accessibility affects us web developers in two ways. First, it defines standards of usability that we can (or must) comply with. Second, it creates an automation challenge. We are, after all, software developers. And making web content accessible is a task. So  it&rsquo;s only natural for us to develop software that makes software accessible&mdash;automatically.</p>
<p>Early in my study of web accessibility, I tried out 10 free programs that assess the accessibility of web pages. For anybody familiar with the state of software, the results were no surprise. Some of the programs found numerous defects, while others found nothing. Some found one defect, while others found another defect. One  of them found defects that didn&rsquo;t really exist. Each of them overlooked defects that at least one of the others discovered.</p>
<p>One possible response to such suboptimal performance is to try to improve it. We can try to create better assessment tools, contribute improvements to existing ones, or work on software that not only assesses content but also makes it accessible.</p>
<p>The problem of accessibility, like the problem of usability, seems likely never to be solved. User interfaces keep incorporating more immersive, multisensory, and thus probably less inherently accessible interactions. Consensuses about the classes of persons entitled to accessibility keep changing. So developers will continue to face challenges, and opportunities, in making accessibility better and more automatic.</p>
