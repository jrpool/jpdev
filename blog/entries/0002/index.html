<h1>Restaurant review: New York Grab &amp; Go</h1>
<p class="author">Jonathan Robert Pool</p>
<p class="summary">New York City offers to feed everybody. How&rsquo;s the food?</p>
</header>
<h2>The restaurant</h2>
<p>Hunger is an old problem, and giving food away is an old solution. Andrew F. Smith&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=tnJBAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false">New York City: A Food Biography</a></cite> records that the Humane Society of New York City began feeding the poor in 1787 and established a soup kitchen in 1802.</p>
<p>New York City in March 2020 launched a new twist on this venerable intervention: single-payer food. Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/174-20/mayor-de-blasio-expands-senior-leadership-team-combating-covid-19-crisis"> appointed a <q>COVID-19 Food Czar</q></a> to <q>create, operationalize and oversee a structure for working New Yorkers to get the food they need during this pandemic</q>. Under the auspices of this <q>GetFoodNYC</q> program, the city&rsquo;s Department of Education began offering free <q>Grab &amp; Go</q> meals at more than 400 locations to any and all comers. Show up, choose from the menu, and take as many meals as you want, no questions asked.</p>
<p>The Grab &amp; Go program was not materially distinct from a major restaurant chain, especially during the take-out era, except that the meals were free. By August 2020, it was <a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9649-new-york-city-massive-emergency-food-program-fall-school-free-food">reportedly providing about a half million meals per weekday</a>.</p>
<p>A year later, in March 2021, the program is still operational.</p>
<h2>The business</h2>
<p>The target consumer populatiuon has been variously described:</p>
<ul>
  <li><img width="170" class="floatright" src="freeforall.jpg" alt="FREE MEALS FOR ALL!">The <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSchools/status/1245822243445211136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1245822243445211136%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabc7ny.com%2Fnyc-free-meals-new-york-coronavirus-mayor-de-blasio%2F6072252%2F">Department of Education</a>:<q>ALL</q>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/food/community-meals">Department of Education</a>: <q>all New Yorkers.</q></li>
  <li><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/contact/services/COVID-19FoodAssistance.shtml">GetFoodNYC</a>: <q>all children or adults in need</q>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/free-grab-and-go-meals-now-available-anyone-need">mayor</a>: <q>a half million New Yorkers who lost their job as a result of COVID-19</q> (in contrast with his earlier definition, <q>working New Yorkers</q>).</li>
  <li><a href="https://abc7ny.com/nyc-free-meals-new-york-coronavirus-mayor-de-blasio/6072252/">ABC News</a>: <q>anyone who needs food</q>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, sources differ. Is Grab &amp; Go like public education, which arguably works better (and enjoys more political support) when rich and poor alike participate? Or is it a fixed-sum resource that it is unethical to take from unless you are hurting? The city is letting you decide.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>How successful has Grab &amp; Go been in achieving its (ambiguous) mission in the first year?</p>
<p>The program <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/food-to-go-did-nyc-open-grab-and-go-sites-in-areas-with-the-greatest-need-schools-brief-july-2020.html">was evaluated in July 2020 by the city&rsquo;s Independent Budget Office</a>. Its report found the Grab &amp; Go locations well located for low-income neighborhood penetration and proximity to students, but patronage too low to satisfy more than a fraction of the need.</p>
<p>What fraction? If all New Yorkers were to get three meals a day from Grab &amp; Go, the volume would be about 25 million per day, so the actual volume would be 2% of the expected volume. If, instead, the target market were only <a href="http://www.centernyc.org/inequality-poverty">New Yorkers in poverty</a>, the success rate would increase to about 10%.</p>
<p>Given the price (free), why the weak demand? One possible cause is the schedule: Grab &amp; Go is open for business 10 hours <strong>per week</strong>! Yes, you must arrive between 3 and 5 p.m. on a weekday (except when the schedule has been changed to start at noon and end at 3 p.m. or service has been canceled because of expected inclement weather). Impractical if, as the mayor originally claimed, the target customers are <q>working New Yorkers</q>.</p>
<h2>One example</h2>
<p>A Grab &amp; Go location on the Upper West Side illustrates the weak demand. It is one block from the thousand-unit low- and moderate-income Amsterdam Houses, but the foot traffic is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>That should be no surprise. There are no banners, sign spinners, beacons, barkers, or sandwich boards. Just an inconspicuous door label, adjacent to five other door labels. A barely legible sign at the sidewalk advertises meals, but only for public-school students, so a passer-by could easily conclude that <strong>no</strong> meals for the public are available.</p>
<p><img width="100%" src="doors.jpg" alt="six doors of Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, with small paper signs illegible from the sidewalk. Access to the doors is by stairs and a ramp."></p>
<p>Even if you are curious enough to ascend the stairs or ramp and approach the doors, there is a <q>GRAB &amp; GO MEALS</q> label one one door, but it says nothing more. What is a Grab &amp; Go meal? Who is entitled to it? What does it cost? When can you get it? Not disclosed.</p>
<p><img width="100%" src="doorsign.jpg" alt="2 adjacent doors, with STUDENT EXIT and GRAB &amp; GO MEALS signs"></p>
<p>If you are even more assertive, and digitally astute, you could visit the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/">official website of the City of New York</a> to learn about help with food. Say you click the search icon and enter <q>food</q>.</p>
<p><img width="100%" src="nycsite.png" alt="official NYC website with food entered as a search query"></p>
<p>The hits on the next page are sorted by relevance, and the first hit is <q>NYC Food</q>.</p>
<p><img src="nycfood.png" alt="NYC Food as search hit"></p>
<p>That looks promising, so you click it. What appears? Oops: the dreaded 404 page.</p>
<p><img src="404.png" alt="Not found. The requested URL /nycfoods was not found."></p>
<p>If you are stratospherically persistent, you surmise that the URL was a typo, and <kbd>nycfoods</kbd> should really have been <kbd>nycfood</kbd>. So you delete the <kbd>s</kbd> and try again. Voil&agrave;! You get the website of NYC Food Policy. Then you continue navigating. If you guess right, you successively click <q>Programs</q>, then <q>Food Assistance &amp; Access</q>, then <q>Emergency Food</q>, then <q>FoodHelp.nyc Food Map</q>. That produces an <a href="https://nyc-oem.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d781ef8a46cf417dbbfaf28f3b902ac4">interactive map of food sources</a>, including Grab &amp; Go meals. If you can understand several paragraphs of instructions (such as <q>Set the buffer distance</q>) and maneuver on a web map tool, you can find a Grab &amp; Go location near you and learn when it is open. Even then, the instructions will label these meals <q>Grab &amp; Go meals at NYC schools</q>, tempting you to misinterpret them as student-only meals. The map also contains inaccuracies (such as a Western Beef grocery store that closed two months ago) and no method for reporting errors.</p>
<p>So, Grab &amp; Go is not being kept secret, but the barriers to access are formidable. No surprise that Trader Joe&rsquo;s has lines two blocks long, while Grab &amp; Go (at least in the observed location) has none.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>But one cannot analyze the demand for food without considering the food itself. Are Grab &amp; Go meals fresh, tasty, nutritious, conveniently arranged, varied, environmentally benign, and culturally appropriate? Are they so great that word of mouth might fill the publicity void? Or do customers, after trying the meals, tell their friends and relatives not to bother?</p>
<p>Grab &amp; Go publishes a bit of information about meal quality. It says that vegetarian, Halal, and Kosher meals are available at some or all locations. It also <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/food/community-meals">lists items that <q>may</q> be offered</a>, namely <q>Baked Ravioli, Beef Burgers, Burrito (Southwest), Buttermilk Biscuits, Buttermilk Pancakes, Chicken (Oven-Roasted &amp; Sliders), Fish Patty, French Fries, Garlic Toast, Grilled Cheese, Jamaican Beef Patty, Mac & Cheese, Mozzarella Sticks, Omelet, Pizza, Stuffed Shells, Turkey (Oven-Roasted and Breakfast Sausage Patty) and Waffles</q>.</p>
<p>Peruse this menu, and you notice a curious absence: No fruits and almost no vegetables, only <q>french fries</q>. Well, <q>garlic</q>, too. So, you could wonder whether Grab &amp; Go heeds the advice of the <cite><a href="https://dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf">Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020&ndash;2025</a></cite> to include in one&rsquo;s diet <q><strong>Vegetables of all types</strong>&mdash;dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other vegetables</q>.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s kill the suspense. How&rsquo;s the food?</p>
